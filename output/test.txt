you know , one of the great <unk> travel , and the joys of the <unk> research is in common with people who are still able to recall the other old days , and they &apos;re able to touch the past the <unk> rocks they touch in the bitter sheets of plants .
just knowing that <unk> still is beyond the milky way , or the importance of the mysteries of myths , or that the the way that the buddhist <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> that we &apos;ve been taking , although successful , many generations .
and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re born , we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to be the <unk> schism by death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but what is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the <unk> in the forests of kibera , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> of <unk> , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are other more <unk> , other ways , other ways of thinking , other ways of the world are in the world .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can fulfill a hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world is a network of <unk> and <unk> life that the earth is equally as important as the biological <unk> that you know as the standard of <unk> .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> , as the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and <unk> that the human imagination has been defined since the beginning of the consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all we are , and what we &apos;re doing as an amazing species of species .
and as the biosphere had been touched with the biosphere , this was happening with the <unk> -- just with the speed .
no biologist for example , to say that 50 percent of the species is just about extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the most <unk> <unk> in the field of biological diversity -- almost scarcely what we &apos;re known as a <unk> <unk> in the field of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is dying of languages .
as any of you were born in this room , the world was 6,000 languages spoken on the world .
now , a language is not just the sum of the <unk> of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of one particular culture is access to the material world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a salient point , an inflection , an idea , an ecosystem possibilities .
and from those 6,000 languages , we &apos;re going to sit in monterey here , in the same half of children &apos;s ears .
they &apos;re taught to infants , which is when nothing &apos;s done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being left to be <unk> , one of the last person who speak your language , no way to give the wisdom of the ancestor , or to expect to hope ?
and yet , this horrible fate of the world is actually someone else on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , is a elderly person , and take the last <unk> of an old language with the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if the world is not a better place , if we &apos;re all just going to talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would see , suddenly , how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so , i want to take you to a trip today , i &apos;m going to take a little bit about the <unk> , a short trip through the <unk> to try to make them understand what actually has been lost .
now , there are some of us , which is in some sense that i say , when i say , &quot; different possibilities of his existence , &quot; really different possibilities of the existence .
take this child &apos;s <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people who <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east in the belly of holy snakes .
this is a people that &apos;s not <unk> between the colors of blue and green , because the forest is <unk> the forest , which is <unk> .
they have a strange language and a <unk> who called linguistic <unk> : you have to get someone who talks another language .
all of this roots in the <unk> past , which is in the <unk> of these large houses where the <unk> of six or seven languages , though , is that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
they just hear it and start to speak .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people first , the first year was been contacted .
in 1957 , five <unk> , tried to record five <unk> and made a <unk> mistake .
they threw pictures from the air , which we would score as a friendly , and i forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives never had seen something .
they lifted these photographs from the forest floor , tried behind the face or the figure , not found , they found no business business of the devil , and killed the five <unk> with the <unk> .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t just cut up and a <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths is held by <unk> .
we were going back to eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we have the people with <unk> , they gave them to be so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him with the <unk> .
but at the same time they had a clear appreciation of forests that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps and determine what kind of this one .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job , as i was at harvard at harvard , whether i was interested in the way to infiltrate in haiti and <unk> the <unk> societies , which was used to infiltrate the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the poison that was used to make sure .
to give a sense of this <unk> , of course , i had to think about this remarkable belief of knowledge and <unk> , is not the cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex kind of kind of kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the big world religions recall what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , buddhism , whatever .
a continent is always exuberant , because the guess is that in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was a and <unk> , just the reminiscent of this very profound religious thought , the <unk> diaspora of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting is so interesting , this live relationship is between the living and the dead .
the remaining give rise to the minds .
the ghosts can be <unk> , the answers to the big water , to lie on the rhythm of the living in the living , so that the <unk> is for a short <unk> moment to god .
<unk> people like to say , &quot; your white <unk> is your church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple , and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with , you will be taken by the mind . how can you harm ?
see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal without combustion , an amazing visualization of the ability to affect the body so that it &apos;s <unk> when it &apos;s in an extreme arousal of extreme arousal .
now , of all people who have met , the <unk> of nevada were <unk> de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization , which is the caribbean of the caribbean of columbia and the aftermath of the conquest , the people moved to a <unk> <unk> massively <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the <unk> .
until the day today , they become a ritual priesthood , which is an <unk> priesthood , but is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are separated at the age of three and four years , in the front of the glacier in the base of darkness , in <unk> on the base of the glacier for 18 years . two of time at the <unk> of their mother &apos;s lap , they now spend a <unk> in the <unk> of the great mother .
and during that time , they will be culturally in the values of their societies , values that the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the environmental -- balance .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , they will suddenly come out and the first time in your life , at the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of the first light , when the sun starts back and says , &quot; look ? it &apos;s really , like me .
it &apos;s like that . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we either <unk> and the old attains of the fancy wild wild <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> thought , or , and say , these people are more connected than we .
so , native &apos;s not <unk> , they &apos;re not going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of space for the <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a mysterious <unk> of earth , which is shaped by the way that the earth can be in the way that it is going to be in the human mind .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andes that you think is that the mountain is a <unk> , who is a <unk> , or your destiny , that &apos;s a pile of rocks , that &apos;s been worn down .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind , or a bunch of <unk> is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor is the metaphor of the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are going to be <unk> .
and that made me another person as my friends under the <unk> who believe that these forests of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> ghosts , the most <unk> of the world , ghosts that they would participate in their <unk> .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reality , you can understand some of them , and this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took it last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which is the most of you &apos;ve heard , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
what makes the fascinating thing that fascinating is not just the most expensive potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s processing . it &apos;s actually made it from two different sources .
this plant contains some very potent , some very powerful <unk> that are the serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , like this stuff , that substance , which they also creates in different ways also <unk> .
this powder is about as a <unk> at a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it will not be <unk> reality of reality , but the unraveling of reality .
i even have a professor , richard evan <unk> , who was the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic <unk> in mexico , and i argued that you can &apos;t feel that , because you can see that the effect , you &apos;re not going to experience a <unk> .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be taken <unk> , because they can be <unk> by a human gut , of course , <unk> enzyme <unk> .
they can be taken only in relation with some other chemicals that the mao <unk> .
now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that contain in the <unk> are <unk> from the way that are necessary to be the <unk> of <unk> , so they ask yourself .
how can these people from 80,000 species of <unk> plants not find these two types of <unk> plants , which is , in the way that combined , as a <unk> version , which is so much larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and mistakes , which is meaningless .
but ask the native americans say , &quot; the <unk> is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 varieties of <unk> that you see all at all of the forest that you see in a very large distance in the forest that we appear to be as a way .
and then you ask them , as you put your <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand some of plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take every 17 varieties of <unk> and they sing them in a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t make a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
well , the problem is the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult position of the native to have to look at them as <unk> and <unk> , but somehow , but in addition to the past , the world , which is the bottom .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re in the 20th century , in 300 years , not for the war or technological innovation , but rather than in a era of biological and cultural diversity on earth either have active and passively addiction . so the problem is not change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> don &apos;t stop at the sioux when they were <unk> and rule as americans stopped when they were the americans to be the <unk> .
not change and technology , the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s really , and they &apos;re ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re going to see in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not <unk> , and these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is <unk> , whose existence is <unk> , which is <unk> , which were <unk> during the <unk> .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet where i &apos;m going to see a lot of the most <unk> face of the political domination .
you know , the holocaust , the <unk> extinction of people will not be convicted of <unk> , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lives of people , not only not not copyright , but generally , but in general and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering if you don &apos;t have seen it in a <unk> level .
i once with a young colleagues , 6,000 miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and i was just when i came to the lhasa , and i was seeing the face of the statistics that you hear . 6,000 , people who were transformed during the cultural revolution by the <unk> of the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle bug in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned to be in punishment for the crimes of chinese .
he was in a prison in the age of two years to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live .
the sister who did this brave <unk> , was brought in a <unk> .
and one day they came up on a <unk> <unk> and for this <unk> , they had to be a tough labor camp .
the suffering is <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people can be <unk> .
and at the end , we really want to do a choice . do we want to be in a <unk> world of the world &apos;s world , or in a world &apos;s world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist before she said she was that it &apos;s her greatest fear that while we go towards a thread , <unk> , in the way , we &apos;ve ever been to wake up , and remember that there were ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that we brought us , and we &apos;re in this moment of the cult of the <unk> of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> and hierarchy of <unk> and specialization and surplus -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story tells me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these kinds of <unk> after the importance of human human human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will be able to be able to be able to be able to be the way that we are : people with the importance of people and gardens that are able to flourish , and there are great moments of the optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took up at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , i was a wonderful tale of his grandfather .
the eastern government administration doesn &apos;t always have been very well with the inuit , and during the most <unk> years of the <unk> of our domination , they were forced to move to the neighborhoods .
the <unk> man refused to be .
the family who had been afraid of his life , he took all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear in the cold , they used to be in their advantage .
the <unk> of their sled were originally taken out of fish that was made in <unk> .
the death man &apos;s death wasn &apos;t fear about the arctic night or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out , his pants off <unk> down and <unk> in his hand , and when the fecal fecal started in the <unk> , he formed them into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the side of the <unk> and it was completely frozen frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> the skeleton , and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a little dog on and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> belt .
that &apos;s how you can do anything .
and this is a symbol of many ways , a symbol of the resistance of the supply and all of the native of the world .
the eastern government was the <unk> , in april 1999 the complete control of the field of the time , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country of our own country and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s a independent area . you &apos;re all control of all the <unk> .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can be able to look for the <unk> and achieve .
and finally , i think , it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are going to be able to see the distant goals of the world , to realize that they &apos;re not even away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination that &apos;s been <unk> in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids are going to participate in the geography of our own children .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we probably have the best institution in the world , our website , 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations are sending our <unk> .
our magazines will read from millions .
and we &apos;re a series of travel in the <unk> , where we take our audience to places like such cultural wonder that you can see from the spirit of the experience , and hopefully , you can find a <unk> in the world &apos;s wisdom of all people to our shared well-being .
thank you .
so what i first think about how quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we can deal with microsoft &apos;s a <unk> , which is <unk> , and it &apos;s a environment in which they can deal with a huge amount of visual data .
we see many of <unk> on digital photos , which you &apos;re in and continuously <unk> , <unk> , in a way , to new new ways .
and it &apos;s no matter how many information we see how big these collections are or how big ones are the images .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter because the only thing that the performance of a system like that can be in the way , is the number of pixels on your screen at every moment , and it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can really show something like this , to really show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a issue from the guardian .
every great picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really , and the good experience a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the the guardian in the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than in the normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see you here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this really helps really get these ideas to the constraints for the available space on the screen .
we hope that this means no longer <unk> and other nonsense more , that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we will contribute to this realm .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of the nasa .
now let &apos;s take something else .
so this is actually live on the internet . you can see it .
this is a project called the name of the <unk> , which actually actually bring two different technologies together .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of washington , under the university of <unk> , under the <unk> of <unk> .
and rick <unk> had done by microsoft &apos;s research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we can actually be able to penetrate this kind of view where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the <unk> scales .
but the spatial orientation is actually , in fact , in fact , of meaning .
the <unk> have hold these pictures so that they have the real space , which is where all the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , the <unk> , you see here from <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> , and those things were all of the space in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;m still showing you other environments .
there is what the whole thing is much more .
i &apos;d like to show you a <unk> of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , and this is a early prototype of the <unk> that we first worked in summer to show you what i think it &apos;s really obvious so obvious when you look at the environment that we have on the site .
we had to worry about the lawyers because of that .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral of dame , which got entirely in the computer with images of flickr . give them in a <unk> and you will get pictures of men in <unk> and and so forth , and every of this orange <unk> is a picture that was discovered as a <unk> .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in in the way in the way that they &apos;re in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
and you know , i never believe that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
i suspect you can see that this is many different types of cameras : everything is the <unk> of the <unk> , a very large number of them that were all in the neighborhood .
and if you can , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird .
many of you are covered by faces , etc .
there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here &apos;s them .
this is actually a poster from notre dame that was been recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all of the collective memory of how , visual earth looks like -- and everything is going to connect with each other .
all these photos are connected to each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they &apos;re getting a model that comes out of all the earth .
so consider this as the continuation of the work of stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s been through the complexity of the complexity , and it &apos;s growing and use it to use the user with the use .
their own photos will have <unk> <unk> who has another person .
if someone has done , and all of those saints and all of those saints and you realize who are all of them , then i can use my photograph of the <unk> of the other people , and so , and make a kind of <unk> <unk> of social experience with using other <unk> .
and of course , <unk> all are the vast virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that are not only by <unk> or satellite satellite and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
and i understand it right ? your software is allowing you to a certain point in the next few years , all of the images that are used in common with a way in common ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter about discover different .
if you want you to do <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think of the <unk> of information that you think of the <unk> of these images .
like if you do a <unk> for images where you could type sentences and the text of the website , a lot of information that is the picture .
but how would you be like , if the picture you connected to all their images ?
then the volume of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance that makes it makes it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , as i hope , in the face of other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself a few compounds , if you haven &apos;t noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all the western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is the pursuit of our citizens , this is all about the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good for itself , valuable , make sense , a <unk> premise for the human .
when people have freedom , then each of us have been to do things that we can maximize our public and nobody has to do for us .
the way to maximize freedom is choice .
the more choices , the more freedom , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common more and they have more .
this is , i think , as deep in our water supply that it would not really be able to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply deeply in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we can do with modern progress .
this is my supermarket . not big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
there are 40 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 extra extra <unk> and 12 <unk> they could buy a huge amount of their lettuce in the unlikely , that &apos;s not the uprising for her .
so that &apos;s like the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> business for a firm -- speaker , a <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , and in this one bar , there &apos;s so many <unk> facilities .
we can put <unk> million different varieties of energy plants , which are offered to be offered in this one .
you have to admit that that &apos;s a great selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have any phone , and he was able to have long to get off ma bell .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t bought it .
a consequence of it was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have a never-ending selection of selection , especially in the world of the mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you &apos;ve not seen this until you haven &apos;t seen it too , can you be safe that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is enabling people to walk into the business and make it question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more <unk> than the only of the human life , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states , which is the united states , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and taking risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and taking the risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it to the patient republic . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift in the <unk> of the <unk> of decisions that knows something -- and that &apos;s why not in the best constitution is to meet a decision -- <unk> the patient .
there is an enormous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like them and me , that if you think about it , all doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor at the next morning , and to ask a change of the way .
something like our identity is a question of choice , as this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t really <unk> identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re making us as often as we want to do .
that means that every day , if you wake up tomorrow , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , it was a time where the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and they could just get them quickly , and then they were so quickly as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
today , it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful smart students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask yourself , &quot; should i marry ? i should get married ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or do it just a career ? &quot;
those are all kinds of questions .
and they will answer these questions regardless of whether that means all the tasks i &apos;m trying to get to and not get good grade in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . this is important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed as carl does it , with technology that allows us every minute of every single room on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the corner of the way i &apos;m going to tell no tell you about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means , that incredible freedom of choice we have to make sense of work , again and again and again , we should work , or not work .
we can watch our kids playing soccer , and we have our mobile phone on the hip , and our blackberry in other hip , and probably on our own own own .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute , every minute we &apos;re asking our child at the <unk> of a <unk> &apos;s <unk> , we also ask us , &quot; should i think that call ? &quot;
should i write this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , it &apos;s certainly the experience of your child is very different than it would have been .
wherever we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in the lives .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all of it was a question of choice .
and the world is like that we live in now .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it is , so i &apos;m going to be bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
a effect , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> instead of getting <unk> instead .
so many options can choose , it will be very difficult to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another more example of this , a study of investing in volunteers .
one of me , a <unk> to <unk> <unk> , the giant <unk> of <unk> , from about a million of <unk> and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> of the employers <unk> , which was about two percent .
they offer 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees are going to be part of the time if they were only offer it five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> , who are the choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose it to be a <unk> .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course .
and you understand that this is not only about , that people have to eat food food , because they don &apos;t have enough money to deal with it , it means that they &apos;re so hard to be able to miss great <unk> of your employers .
through that , they &apos;re not going to be involved 5,000 dollars a year on the <unk> , who had been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s what it &apos;s like this .
they want to really make the decision really really , if it &apos;s all of eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the <unk> investment , or even the wrong thing .
so that &apos;s a effect . the other effect is that even if we can get over the paralysis and make a decision , we &apos;re going to end less comfortable with the outcome of the choices , when we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is to take a different <unk> of different <unk> if you buy a buy , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is <unk> is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine , even if it was a good choice .
the more options there is , the more simple thing is not to regret at all , that &apos;s the <unk> for the choices that they meet .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has taken a big point in this morning , by telling the way that we judge things about what we compare it .
well , if there is lots of alternative to concerns , it &apos;s simply attractive qualities to imagine alternatives that they exclude , which is they make less content with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here is what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the studio .
very expensive estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s been following two weeks of the thought he has the ability to have a great way to have a great parking lot .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> , the happiness that we preserve through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more options there are choices , the more attractive features of that choice will be considering into the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is a number of statements .
he makes a message to live in now and maybe things slowly .
but a more important thing he &apos;s doing is , always , who is it for a cause , they don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like many attractive qualities , and it will be able to do less appealing .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this has me me when i wanted to share my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was just a time in the only kind of thing , and they bought them , and they have bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and they were having a long time , and they were often , they started , &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after many years of the <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the man said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , light <unk> or a long ?
do you want to bend or <unk> ? stone or acid .
do you want to hang jeans with holes ?
you &apos;re just like cut down the bottom , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
my pine jaw was down , and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour to wipe all this damn jeans , and <unk> the business -- and i say the best thing -- with the best , the jeans i ever had .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i was worse to feel worse with all these available possibilities , my expectations for a good amount of jeans .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations than it was just in a way .
when you were in 100 species , it &apos;s been perfect , to be perfect .
and what i was was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i was expected , and what i had was so much compared to what i expected .
and that allows us to have to increase in the lives of people , the expectations have inevitably the people who are going to be good at the possibilities of it .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are well .
no one in the world &apos;s <unk> knows this . because if you would , you know , you all of the idea is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that it was better than anything was worse than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to make experience a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we live rich , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for you can ever hope is that things as well as you expect it .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because your expectations , my expectations are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve come to all -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a second short moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always so much bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a bad at a bad point to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit that if you &apos;re unhappy , and you wonder why , who &apos;s responsible for the answer . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re buying a fisherman and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question .
they could have better to do better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there is no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , you feel comfortable about it , they accuse themselves .
so clinical depression , exploded in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression and also suicide , is that people have experienced so high , and then , if you need to explain those experiences themselves . and then , if you need to explain those experiences themselves .
and so the <unk> is that it &apos;s better better , it &apos;s objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> , which is that we all think about it is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there is no question that there is a little choice than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choices than a little choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time to the choice of our good good .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule of the things that we think about is , which is what makes all these choices to the industrialized societies , the material wealth is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too much selection .
and the problem is they &apos;re too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying , steve <unk> has told you about these more expensive and hard to <unk> car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they &apos;re actually hurt .
and they worry about it &apos;s worse .
if something of the people of our society enabled so making decisions about the societies in which people would move too little selection , not only life , but it would be improved .
economists call this an <unk> application .
<unk> is going to worry that it &apos;s all better -- not only the poor -- because all of these great selection is us <unk> .
and finally , please , please , please , this cartoon , and a very sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what &apos;s this fish ?
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> &apos;s imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
and the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view of the fish that &apos;s a little bit .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , you get the happiness .
it &apos;s increasing paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost to limited security , possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is a <unk> metaphor is a recipe for misery and , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects already before , about the human genome and what that means , and about discovery of the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re going to start by a new point : we &apos;ve digitized the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code in a new stage of biology , and build new life .
we always have important questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists have tried to understand and at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years ago , when we sequenced the <unk> movement made itself beyond the digital world in biology to the digital world .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we live life , or whether we can create new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , in mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of a species can replicate itself in the lab , and we can &apos;t try to achieve that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes from 500 or so that &apos;s here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that &apos;s very simple , in comparison with our own . trust it , that &apos;s simple , but if we can eliminate all of us , it &apos;s very unlikely to eliminate it to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to the first is that chromosome , in fact , to actually vary the individual components and so some of the fundamental questions .
and so we started asking with the question , we can make a chromosome .
so , the chemistry is to make these really large molecules that has never been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is so just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps at the digitize life is exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but still increased , and our final point now is going to put on an exponential curve .
we started with it 15 years ago .
it took actually a <unk> review of the time before we did the first experiments .
it turns out it turns out is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to create small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new way to do with these little pieces and put the mistakes .
this was our first attempt to do starting with digital information , the genome x 174 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
we made little pieces , made a <unk> and a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came up when we took this piece of chemical chemical chemical and put into a bacterium , and the bacterium started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral of the viral were then taken off of the cells and got back and killing e. coli .
i &apos;ve talked to the oil industry , and they said they &apos;d like to be able to understand this model .
they laughed more than you here .
so , we think that &apos;s a situation in the software is actually building your own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters of genetic code , so we could vary the size of the <unk> , to understand what the individual components of a living in the city .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re going to start using digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome was in 1995 , the <unk> of <unk> had a <unk> pair of pairs on pairs of pairs .
we found at <unk> 30 mistakes , if we used the original sequence of the sequence it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are the 50 letters long and the other <unk> pieces of doing the other <unk> pieces , to build smaller <unk> .
we have a unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> installed .
think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and ts .
so , the letters of this letters -- this letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there is a single one of those amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first , we &apos;ve been signed .
some people were disappointed to be disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces of so we can break them simply with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair and reappear again .
and we started making pieces , starting with the five to <unk> letters of five to <unk> letters , would put these together to make these together to <unk> these back together .
in every step , we have made these pieces in the surplus so because we could sequence them because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of the <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with about 100,000 pairs pairs -- then they &apos;re not just going to grow into e. coli , it &apos;s exceeds all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we started to shape other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which is used to fix the dna of the biology that can make these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of that . there is an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the top field that its chromosome is simply falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything else has been together again .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life is in space and moving in looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve used by using these processes -- actually we just use the <unk> with the right design of the things we have them <unk> . yeast automatically automatically automatically automatically .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
that &apos;s footage over a every six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve done recently .
this is over <unk> letters , <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that has ever been created by humans .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a <unk> of 10 and without the distances it would be <unk> pages , just to <unk> these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re doing it in <unk> like we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus and you have a different in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about clones .
in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome to another , and it can activate them .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> , and in <unk> , these two of them apart from each other than the mice and mice , and we could choose a few of the proteins . we &apos;re going to take the chromosome . we &apos;re going to give them to <unk> all of the proteins .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process .
that &apos;s the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all species of species here , the second chromosome , and a third of <unk> , every time thousands of characteristics in just a single species of a species .
so people who have changed a gene that &apos;s been changed at a moment that have been missing a lot of biology .
there are enzymes the <unk> of the <unk> that actually are digest dna .
the chromosome was in the cell , it has none ; the chromosomes that we have put in .
it was <unk> in the cell and then found the other chromosome as alien material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> <unk> , because of the genes we put it .
and after a very short time , it had been lost all the characteristics of species , and <unk> completely in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all of the proteins changed the membranes change -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re going to go through .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can move the <unk> , things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we &apos;re probably a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re starting to go from six to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has 1946 for every year for every year in 1946 , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have <unk> problems with fresh , with fresh , and medicine , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels of the day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is the entire co2 of this material to land in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most of the future of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and see it &apos;s got the diversity of that out of it .
we &apos;re in the first line of the biological reality and the limits of our imagination .
we have technologies now because of these rapid <unk> technologies to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes in the day .
so if you imagine these 20 million different genes or these processes to optimize the processes , or drugs new vaccines , we can change with a only small group of science than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection ; we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a shot of the <unk> that we work with in fact , and you can actually sit and design new species at the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like , and we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look like .
we now focus on the fourth generation of the generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn corn recently , as a bad experiment .
we have a deal with the <unk> and third generation that will be relatively soon going to be able to have much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different types of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way of biology is to have a huge impact on the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability is , if we look at co2 as the light , and so we work on the way that go to the way .
and we think we &apos;re the first with the first <unk> of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a way .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in nearly <unk> <unk> .
it extracts co2 in methane to use of hydrogen as the source of energy .
we can use polluting co2 , we can use polluting co2 , which could easily be able to be able to use co2 , to power that process in fuel to power this process .
within a brief period we believe , we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- <unk> targets like the whole <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do at ted , where otherwise ? a <unk> of the energy ?
but we &apos;re also working on the moment , the same approach to develop the same way of development .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always going on the back of the back of the year and have a dollar to little if it &apos;s going to go .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by using <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what the future may be may look like , can be accelerating today , the <unk> of <unk> , with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we &apos;re getting light light away from people to improve , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive enough to be able to do that , thank you very much .
so at the last ted conference , i was a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s as far as far . and for all those things that were not there at the time , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment ever been addressed -- 27 miles in the diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a second second in the beginning of the universe -- and it &apos;s going to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just high-resolution .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
i work . it &apos;s called the atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you see the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine was going to the first time .
and this image was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s a huge amount of energy control in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that the entire way to the lhc , which is to <unk> with a part of the lhc to bring a rain from particles to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know whether this is the largest <unk> of <unk> , or this is when someone was visiting the google site and found the front page .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with this wires -- these golden wires here here .
these wires conduct <unk> when the machine is running on <unk> .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do . these are little wires . &quot;
you can do that because if you cold them very far , they will call them .
so in minus <unk> degrees , you know , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand tension .
in one of the ties between the <unk> magnet at the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and so they heat wires clicks and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is a thing that &apos;s really amazing if you imagine that the magnet over 20 tons , and about about 30 inches .
so we effectively damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , they <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back to your way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be be <unk> .
we will turn it up and expect to collect the first data on june , or to gather , and we continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .
well , of course , in a kind of contrast , the debate , the debate about the value of science and <unk> on this . it &apos;s easy to reject something like that .
i think it &apos;s so hard to think that it &apos;s so hard to reach beyond our borders , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words in a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i suspect when he argued the <unk> of his <unk> , his apprentice was michael <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there is no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a novelist .
books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that the way that the way is .
but the recent thing is a little strange in my life and my career , which has been brought me to rethink my relationship to this work completely .
this strange event was that i wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , love , love -- the <unk> -- which , which is , the way of all my previous books were out and a big <unk> international <unk> .
the result is that i &apos;m going to be treated , i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i fall to fall .
seriously -- the sunset on the sunset .
for example , they come to be a bit of concerned and say , &quot; don &apos;t you be <unk> that success ?
don &apos;t you worry about that they &apos;re all of your life and never create a book that anyone in the world is interested in the world ?
okay , that makes really courage .
but it would be worse if i don &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i first told the first time of that i was going to be a writer , who was the same kind of <unk> reaction .
people said , <unk> did you not be afraid to succeed ?
do you not fear that you kill the humiliation of a <unk> ?
did you not be afraid that you put this for a lot of your life , and it never will be dying on a <unk> <unk> of <unk> -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
that &apos;s how you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : <unk> yes .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and that &apos;s all of me .
and i fear even more things about that one of the one of the one of the time .
like algae and other things things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time and ask me why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logically that by someone who should be afraid of having the work to do that he feels <unk> ?
and what is the same thing with the creative project that they &apos;re self-conscious about the other of the other mental health -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , i was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years , in which he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemists .
so , with your <unk> , john -- how do it &apos;s you ?
it just didn &apos;t get , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not been getting the call not the call from <unk> <unk> people .
we also have writers seem to have this kind of sound , but not just the writers , but the creative of all of the <unk> , seem to be mentally , mentally , mentally , mentally unstable .
all you need to do is , the bitter <unk> of really have great minds alone from the 20th century , the young and often have died of their own .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually <unk> their <unk> tracks seemed to be neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death interview : <unk> every of my books was killed a little bit more .
a extraordinary message that you can do about their life work .
but we don &apos;t even do that if we &apos;re somebody like this , because we know this kind of statements for so long , and somehow we &apos;ve known the notion of the world and collectively , that &apos;s , of course , that art -- the end of the end -- always leads to the <unk> .
the question i want to ask today is this idea of all right ?
do you feel so much ? because it &apos;s just a centimeter of a centimeter -- i &apos;m not comfortable with this point of all .
i think they &apos;re really about it .
and i think it dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s going taken into the next century .
i think it better if we &apos;re our great creative faith to live .
and i sure it &apos;s been to me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , this dark path of guess -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
that &apos;s called -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write about now in writing is the work that the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re all sort of like , sort of friends , it &apos;s most likely to be , that my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
so , that &apos;s the kind of idea that someone can get someone to start to drink nine in the morning , gin and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so , the question is : how ?
after some time of the <unk> , i &apos;m able to write to write and write a kind of <unk> psychological association .
somehow , i have to find a way to write a safe distance to true between me and i &apos;m very much of the <unk> of the reaction to the <unk> .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in models for models to do that , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they could help to see , whether they could help creativity , which is associated with creativity .
this is what i find is the old greece and the old <unk> .
please follow me , because the circle will be again .
but in the old greece , rome don &apos;t believe that creativity is that creativity , okay ?
they thought that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source of the people who come from -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> of creativity of <unk> <unk> .
from socrates , he thought he would have a <unk> that was going to take off a distance .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a special individual .
they thought that a genius of the magic was being <unk> , that it lives in the walls of a life -- about as <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the artist was to designing invisible and the outcome of work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there is , because it &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct that you &apos;re going from the following of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked so , right ?
the artist of the <unk> was actually protected things like , for example , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at all for you , everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that has helped you .
if your work -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so people thought in the west have been thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s imagine the human individual in the universe -- all of us -- all the way of the universe and mystery -- and there &apos;s no room more for mythical creatures that commands to take by divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of general humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity is completely from their individual .
for the first time , you hear people who are a genius , and they &apos;re a genius , instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , one of a naked person that he thinks he , or as you &apos;re like the vessel and the essence of the <unk> and the essence of divinity , <unk> , endless <unk> is a little bit too much too much .
it &apos;s like somebody to swallow the sun .
the <unk> and graceful all of <unk> all , and it creates all those <unk> expectations .
i think that this <unk> has been annihilated our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t have the <unk> for 500 years of not just killing killed in a <unk> session .
and there are people in this audience who really would have been <unk> to the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to do is : why not ?
why not so much about it ?
because it makes sense of all the things that i &apos;ve heard about , when it was about , the perfectly <unk> <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows that the best has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , in other words , in fact , everybody here -- not always be sensible .
in fact , he can also feel <unk> .
i had a encounter that i had a encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , who was now about 90 , but she told me that she would be comfortable , and i &apos;d hear her <unk> , like the landscape on the landscape .
she would like a <unk> train out of air .
the land was going to be <unk> .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet .
she knew that they could just do it at a moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> <unk> like the devil .
she ran like the devil house during the house she &apos;s been haunted by this poem , and it was just about it quickly to a sheet of paper and a pen , so she could catch it through her way , and to catch up with the leaf .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran , but she would she she missed the house , and she was missed her , and she was missed it . and -- as she said , <unk> after a different poet look at <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were some times in which they were almost missed .
so , she &apos;s walking to the house and looking for the paper and the poem is walking through her and she picks up a pencil , and then she &apos;s -- she said -- she was so like it would reach and to get it to pack .
she caught in the poem at his tail , and it took it back into her body and then took it on the paper .
and so , in this opportunities , the poem was <unk> and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
and when i heard this , i thought , i think , i think , it &apos;s extraordinary -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to happen .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i have to get up every day at the same time , and sweat , i &apos;m really unpleasant <unk> .
but even i even have this thing in my <unk> , sometimes this thing .
and i guess many of you also have done this .
even i had to work or ideas that made from a source by me , which i really cannot identify .
what is that thing ?
and how do we get to lose that in relationship with no , but in the opposite of the opposite health , we can actually think of intellectual health ?
and for me , the best living example , how you can do this , the musician tom <unk> . i was to interview it for a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of the most <unk> of modern , the <unk> , trying to master this <unk> creative <unk> that lived in his family , and with them with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me he was going on a freeway in los angeles , and that &apos;s all changed for him .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly sounds a melody , which is a lot of a melody for the <unk> , and he wants to do it . it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> afterwards , but he can &apos;t take it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to be able to be able to be a <unk> in his shoes , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to be <unk> by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of being panicked , he just stopped .
he stopped all of the thoughts , and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , <unk> excuse me , you cannot see that i &apos;m going to drive ?
<unk> is i look like this as i could just write a song ?
if you really have come , come back to a second moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , <unk> people today .
fast-forward and <unk> cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was often as much as long as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds it around , it was <unk> when he was a <unk> of where he was in trouble , and he &apos;s where he was like , he was found that it had to be a <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , miraculous , weird collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , even physical thing that was not entirely tom .
when i heard this story , it also had a little bit of the way i worked and it has saved me .
this idea was saved me as a middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell in one of those of the <unk> that we fall in , and it &apos;s going to be a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book that ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be <unk> the project .
but then i remembered tom &apos;s <unk> and i tried it .
so i took my view of the manuscript and my comment on the direction of a empty corner of the room .
i spoke to the <unk> , you know , you know , you know , and i &apos;m both sure that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m all of that i have , invest , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to show up and your share with the deal .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the heck is .
i &apos;m going to write a further , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give the research , i want to give the data today , that i was here for my part of the jobs .
because ... the end is the end of the end of the end of the world , and in centuries ago , people have been assembled in the deserts of <unk> dances and <unk> and music , who were assembled , and dawn .
this great great thing was great because the dancer were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , it happened to be special , one of the performers actually became <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen this in your life .
it was like the time of <unk> and the dancers with a kind of <unk> , he did not do anything else than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before . but everything else was together .
and suddenly , he seemed to be more like it seemed more .
it was lit up from the inside , and down from down , and everything <unk> himself through a <unk> fire .
and as something happened , the people did that was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and started singing , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
what &apos;s interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came to <unk> , and the pronunciation was over the course of the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which you &apos;re still hearing at <unk> and <unk> .
when a performer did in spain , impossible , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> , great , <unk> , great , <unk> , <unk> .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part is going to follow the next morning when the dancer itself wakes up and realize that it 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s not a <unk> of god in it .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> knee , and maybe he will never be able to be able to this altitudes .
and maybe never will never name god name , if he &apos;s going to turn , but what about the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so much of <unk> when they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence came from .
if you might just believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of life that will be on somebody else when they &apos;re ready to do it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think i think about security in the past months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s soon to be in the way that it &apos;s soon , frightening , deeply expected to follow my <unk> .
what i &apos;m constantly to say to myself , if i &apos;m going to be mad , i &apos;m not afraid .
not <unk> .
just do your job .
be on your contribution for your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid of god genius , you &apos;re asking , is , you know , for a brief moment a sliver of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if , dance , they still go your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , for you .
i believe in this , and i feel that we should teach the .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you , just for the mere human love and the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate the <unk> that , which has been the the arctic <unk> that had been the size of 48 states , 40 percent .
but that doesn &apos;t mean enough enough to see the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of ice .
in a sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in the winter and expands in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> of which is happening in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is with red marks .
as you see , it &apos;s growing up in the <unk> , this is the annual ice in the winter ; and it &apos;s declining in summer .
this is called <unk> , five years old , is almost like blood , which is the body of the body .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be left .
this is a problem because warming the frozen of the arctic ocean is in which there is huge amounts of carbon dioxide , which is when it <unk> , from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of material material in the atmosphere could double it in the atmosphere , if we cross this critical space .
already in a few flat areas of the desert today in alaska of itself , from itself .
professor <unk> walter at columbia &apos;s columbia is to a another group to another <unk> across the last <unk> .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be us .
and one reason is that this huge reservoir of huge heat warms from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much more than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the level of sea level goes through <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> it into the ocean .
these rivers are taking a little bit .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers announced that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed over a few <unk> is , is particularly very much in the melting .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see up the top of the lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people around the world , half of their <unk> in the world .
in the andean , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , the most of the water &apos;s drinking .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in california , has seen seen the sierra maize .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
these <unk> around the world leads to a dramatic gains in the fire .
and the catastrophes all over the world have been really <unk> and unprecedented extent .
four times as many of the last 30 years in the <unk> <unk> of the last 30 years .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 , and every 24 hours of co2 , 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the realm of the eastern pacific , from the american continent western and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there is a dramatic decline in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is that burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the absence of biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , with china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot of additional <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here &apos;s the ones that were taken out in the last few years , with some of the green alternatives that were suggested .
<unk> is a political dispute in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar last night to promote clean charcoal , which is a oxymoron .
this picture reminded me on something .
so around christmas , i went home at home in tennessee tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america &apos;s <unk> .
this was about christmas .
one of the advertisement of the <unk> of the <unk> of christmas was this .
<unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> , happy boy .
it &apos;s in the <unk> and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> is cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers remain in &apos; distributed and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me quite clear me . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance of climate protection was called the world .
this is one , a part of her .
we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so , we &apos;ve set it to the top of the top of the top , a major <unk> of spending a <unk> to the way to bring the truth about coal .
it &apos;s a fact , coal is not messy .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also smelling too well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave it quietly .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s do a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet , the coal of one of the main reasons is the global warming is the remarkable <unk> of <unk> that you see here , everything changes .
look at it , this is , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all together , is our dependence together , is our dependence on <unk> fuels like the same coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of that <unk> location .
<unk> america with 100 percent cleaner electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to make us secure and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways of the fastest way , our dependence on ancient , soft fuels that we &apos;re all <unk> .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investment to create good jobs .
<unk> america , it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there is an old african african <unk> : &quot; if you want to be , go alone .
if you want to come , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and it quickly .
thank you .
so i want to start to ask you to ask you to the time of your childhood <unk> when they played with <unk> .
while they realized the hands of reaching off and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and move , and actually , they learned to think about thinking and to make change the <unk> of the understanding and change the <unk> .
the spatial thinking is intimately connected how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of things of our interactions with real objects -- with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i started wondering , what would we want to make data and how we want to organize it ?
this question was so <unk> that we decided to research the research and the <unk> evolved .
in a nutshell , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move to your hand , you can see each other , you can detect their movements , and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly : are physically , why you can only move them out of the hands and access to the hands and access .
and the <unk> is an example of a new generation of <unk> to the new generation of the engineering data .
and if these are the tool physical will become physical and an awareness of their movements , and the subtleties of our <unk> with them , then we can start with exploring new and entertaining engineering .
i start with some simple examples of the things .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i put it into a direction , the video will play forward ; if i put it into the other direction , it &apos;s backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other .
so , if i put them side-by-side , you &apos;ll be interested in the interest .
when you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you &apos;ll notice it and you can get something nervous .
and they also feel their movements and tilt .
so an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply normal gestures on data , like how colors as colors as you do with the fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle where they &apos;re going together .
if we exaggerate it . we can do a little bit of <unk> .
there is also some nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we can give people the possibility of fast and and the results immediately immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m making with a simple <unk> .
this is a game that is a game that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of your round to every single <unk> , and as you try to make words words , this is a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s going to be mixed and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up to the media lab , and i could move it to try and take it and i took a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; is words words , and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> on the bottom right there .
it turns out that he wanted to have a pile of the <unk> .
so for him , they were only <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by using the <unk> of the table , which is the character .
here he makes the sun .
the sun is .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor to the scene .
the orange tractor .
good job ! yes !
by using the <unk> tag , and you can put the characters interact with it ...
it &apos;s a <unk> story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open , and he can decide how they evolved .
<unk> cat .
the last example , i think , for this time i &apos;ve now , is a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve evolved recently , and in the <unk> as a sound , like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can rearrange these notes into the sequence that can organize in certain patterns .
and you &apos;re a <unk> you to just hold a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are the effects that can change live , like reverberation and filter .
you put it with a particular tone and it becomes a <unk> .
and then the laws effects like the speed and volume that you put on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start in the <unk> , we &apos;re going to organize the <unk> into two <unk> and and to expand and to expand and add a little bit more .
now i throw a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something drums .
and now i put the filter with the drums so i can use the effect of live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by which i can move the speed in one or another direction .
and now i put the filter with the bass , which is more expression .
i can change the sequence as it comes in .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan it in advance , but can improvise ; they &apos;re <unk> .
and finally , i can fall through the whole sequence by looking at the <unk> on the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire to develop new <unk> , which is better to the way that our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time , you have a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way is that we are at the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to interacting with digital media to the digital media , which is the <unk> of our demands .
thank you .
and i &apos;m looking forward to you for the conversation with you all .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
so , yeah , what should be <unk> ?
i have to step back a little bit , and that &apos;s busy <unk> with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been working with the <unk> , and i started to actually , i just wanted to actually do a particular way , and it &apos;s also about how to do what i was in the study of research .
that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get a closer to the matter of the way .
i think that &apos;s in general now , so generally , in general , biotech , everything you &apos;re about , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely importantly , it &apos;s extremely important , and it &apos;s much more important , much more importantly , will be more important .
there &apos;s so <unk> things like these entire engineered plants were changing on the <unk> .
there are now craig venter in the <unk> that &apos;s trying to make <unk> , so gasoline of algae .
there is also things that are totally in the world that most people are , but not aware of the , for example , that allow us to wash , with 40 degrees of water , also also genetically <unk> things .
and the list can continue and continue .
and so , in the interest of this technology , i &apos;m going on to keep on <unk> .
so what &apos;s hack ?
most people know most people know that from the <unk> .
computers hack , and then it becomes all the media as well , the hackers break somewhere in a and claws and so on .
this is a little bit of the most sad thing , because it doesn &apos;t really , what they actually did like it was really starting and what &apos;s happening behind it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also formed the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creativity , original original way to solve a problem .
and the problem that &apos;s not just a technological problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a <unk> of what things simplify , so you can make it differently , and how can you make it better .
and it &apos;s been able to do it , but there &apos;s a software in the <unk> , there &apos;s a whole <unk> of the things that make all kinds of things things .
and now , too , too , too , and i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , is that biology is actually a <unk> , because it &apos;s a abstract code , because it &apos;s matter , and it &apos;s matter , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it too , too , too , too , you also <unk> it , and i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper with the .
it actually has just accepted eight really , it &apos;s actually accepted , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india , but now , but there &apos;s members of people everywhere in the world .
so , that &apos;s a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s lots of artists and philosophers and working together with scientists with scientists , just with these technologies and ask and ask the creative , and to do the creative , and yes , everything .
but it &apos;s always always about to find such a <unk> access to this , so that &apos;s such a open-ended thing .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is a network of the network of the network , which is actually more like a sphere where you &apos;re going to get and online online .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical approach and a little bit of <unk> on the way , and then , there &apos;s a little bit of asking questions .
and from those networks that the whole popular thing has made , has evolved to be a scene that i &apos;d like to go to a minute .
here &apos;s the picture on the top of the top , you see , this is a <unk> , so , in principle a school , a private school , a private school , where everybody can be .
kids , old , all kinds of people go to the way , just to just go through , they put a laboratory and look at what can you do when they go into this <unk> .
here &apos;s a group of indonesia here , is a group in indonesia , which is the one that &apos;s pretty long .
we have longer than these other two networks .
and the ones that are also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , and combine it in pretty much more sophisticated way .
a group from ankara that i &apos;ve seen a while ago , that &apos;s a <unk> that would have to convey the public more , what they &apos;d like to learn in college and have to explain people &apos;s so much of doing what &apos;s <unk> .
and i &apos;ve got a lecture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the other way , a lecture in copenhagen in the medical museum in the world .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s the most popular people , but the only thing that is actually the same , is that fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and they also really specific to the society and asking questions , so , ok , what are you want to join , you &apos;re interested in the way of maintaining it ?
so , <unk> , to hack biology , you need to be kind of material .
you need to use biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or , what you &apos;re really understanding in a lab , which is so kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely distant , just for <unk> , skilled academics , <unk> , and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every every single world has actually developed the same way higher technology than most of the <unk> , that &apos;s really like that .
and it &apos;s been my head with this premise , for example , brian <unk> in england tried to put a <unk> <unk> , then it took a <unk> , a <unk> , and yes , so <unk> , it &apos;s actually <unk> .
so every one of the soup that has been <unk> for long , it has done too long .
i then tried to expand a little bit a little bit , and i &apos;d bought a little bit of <unk> on ebay and a little bit of analysis analysis , trying to do a <unk> , so as a <unk> <unk> , even time .
so this should not be a joke now , but it &apos;s going to be a joke .
so here &apos;s the lab in the picture , you see the lab , so , so , is a <unk> garage with also so much <unk> , which has been established , and pretty interesting things , and i want to do a project to a little bit .
and this is <unk> , who &apos;s also mentioned <unk> , this one , so , so a kind of <unk> principle in principle is a <unk> of biology .
and so , you see , it &apos;s relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s what you have to do in the age of people who are going to be , so far , to the big organizations that have more <unk> too much in the form of <unk> .
but just always the approach that it &apos;s just to be easy and accessible to it .
the first project we did as an international group , as we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , we know , we &apos;re really aware of ourselves , and we &apos;re now , we know so the people who are all chatting and so .
and then , from the <unk> website website , the founder of the founders , and he said , we really have to meet real , but we &apos;ve got two events , one in london , a <unk> , and shortly to it in san francisco .
and , there &apos;s also about , yes , who are we , what are we want to do what we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our values , what are our data ?
and then we have a <unk> mechanism .
so that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just so his wishes to get his and what it goes , i mean , then .
and there was a really good code , i think , a really good code .
and we don &apos;t have it compulsory , but that &apos;s what i think has already been really good on , people are right now .
and we actually tried to do that in the academic world , but there &apos;s somehow not like this .
so , i think we &apos;re from the <unk> , in the way , even a step further than the academic world .
so , what do we do now ?
a project i &apos;ve done with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we call an optical stain , using optical <unk> .
that &apos;s when you focus a laser beam , you &apos;re in a room , you can catch small particles in the air , and then in this focus , and then in this focus , so , that &apos;s what such a <unk> principle .
and that &apos;s really , really , that &apos;s going to be done in the academic <unk> , and we would have thought , we might have a webcam , then , then , the lens , the lens , you have a microscope , it increases about <unk> .
that &apos;s what you see here .
and then we <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> laser <unk> and then try to focus on this camera .
and that unfortunately , not work , but we have a lot of things like this .
so another project that came from paris in paris , which is , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s so a bit like this , so a <unk> , so , so , so it has something like this , so he &apos;s going to be <unk> with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this helmet and in the cooperation with the museum .
and then , there were the visitors in the room , there are a helmet to sit down this helmet .
then they measured their brainwaves , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is then different lights in the space .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which has been to do with this <unk> , which is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to transmit genes , to multiply , <unk> , fragments , can multiply them to see them visible .
so if i &apos;m going to do that the <unk> of the scene , then , you go to collect some of the <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to do this kind of thing , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this human .
and the machines that are doing so much they &apos;re pretty expensive to buy the cheapest , the cheapest , the cheapest , the cheapest .
and that &apos;s not a <unk> , but it &apos;s really really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of many , you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got two of these <unk> <unk> and say , <unk> , that &apos;s what we do is and cheaper , and we have a cheaper , and then we have the cheapest , the cheapest <unk> of these devices .
i think it was kind of like a six thousand dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly in a framework where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so , it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project i started started to build was a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is taking about so far , two centimeters or so .
you <unk> <unk> on <unk> and then then put them into these <unk> , and then i put it on a <unk> and then i put it up so that way .
so the device that you see here is that it doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my prototype so my prototype , but pretty hadn looked like so on a branch that &apos;s so on a branch that &apos;s on , and it was a <unk> , and it was a high thing to break it .
and then i took a <unk> and it connected to it .
a <unk> , if you get the full of power with water , so i think , so you &apos;re so 40 to <unk> bar about it .
and so , you can easily accelerate the particles and then , and then they go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> or something like that , to the 50 of 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so that &apos;s the moment , the <unk> of the scene , the <unk> of technology is to increase the availability of technology and the information that is that more people can get to be able to get engaged .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little hunch and also not a chance to make it .
because , if you read it about it , you know , it &apos;s not the same as you &apos;ve done it once you have .
and i think technology is increasingly more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make a good decisions in society , and it wants to be able to get , you need to know that access to the knowledge and the technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand .
and then , the <unk> of the <unk> open <unk> and human science .
so , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to get through this scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who &apos;ve been officially <unk> on the website , <unk> website .
so that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and also , it &apos;s interesting , they are represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think is there are less people &apos; there , as in fact .
so i know some of some of you who don &apos;t have been .
and that &apos;s just the <unk> , the individual people .
in part of these <unk> , so , in the way , in this particular , is <unk> .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has it only started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , the <unk> , in berlin was the first one , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> , which are represented all over the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re also also going to do it also , and also also very well connected , so that can also be involved in the way .
and i would invite everyone once to take and just try and to try and try and try and try .
now it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible when you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you can get too far .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we work ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moving by a designer , but also in the field of <unk> and all the things in the field of the field of <unk> .
and there &apos;s how to start with people in interactive media so making these interactive media , and so they create an most meaningful experience .
and i believe that the interactive media in us are using cognitive models , so the paradigm that we have been programmed in our biological memory and that we can build the only through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you &apos;re actually believe that this <unk> that you &apos;ve seen is that the one that is actually , in the future , but actually , it &apos;s so that the future is exactly in the way that we &apos;re in our <unk> roots .
so what are actually <unk> models ?
i wrote a four <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain to a minute .
so , to cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;re in the pre-industrial times , we have .
to this <unk> models of models is that we have a principle of natural relationship to virtuality .
this is what &apos;s unusual at all this kind of thing .
i &apos;m going to take it right now , and i &apos;m going to show you a try to prove that you have natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve since since this physics physics models is really capable of being very , very , very , to speak , although we use a <unk> language .
and the third part of the idea is actually explained from itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition of <unk> , which includes the denial of linearity , and what we &apos;re also says is that we feel the linearity of normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place for us .
now , what is now with the virtuality that actually is the most natural thing in the world .
i want to show you to prove .
how many doors <unk> , the house , in which you live ?
that will we not immediately to answer the right now , but it &apos;s going to happen and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through this house through this house , in <unk> , you live , and look at how many doors there .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
they <unk> reality and it &apos;s all without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there we &apos;re struggling to show the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually show that all the time .
and this is that this wealth that the virtual reality is to <unk> the reality that have been needed to the very well <unk> , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they had no media mass .
the only thing that had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was .
in this head , <unk> and using this virtual images , the imagination , has been passed on .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality as well .
the interesting thing about it is when i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about it is that this time of the human being <unk> and medium itself was .
now , if you think a little bit more .
what are media today ?
then you notice it &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk to the same again .
the primary tool of the <unk> has been known for stories .
<unk> , preacher , called <unk> , they were making extra <unk> to keep knowledge in stories .
and yet we &apos;re very , very much in stories today .
the author of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we still <unk> <unk> hours of stories with the <unk> of stories .
that means to a child that &apos;s to achieve the most of the most of the most of the most of life in its lifetime with the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love is to tell stories that we have a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
that &apos;s much more back , in the cultures of the beginning of the enlightenment .
but for me , but in the realm of interactive media , that we have in <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think .
i brought you an example of bringing from the north american tribe of the <unk> .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you could somehow moved to island , to be able to get food .
and they did that with the so-called <unk> .
you may also know that if you &apos;re a bit interested in this , from the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they used to use the same <unk> <unk> , or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation of movements could be mapped to the topography of regions .
and the language was <unk> by <unk> .
that &apos;s called <unk> about sound and above rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region and that has also allowed that to be able to put these songs and different and so forth , and then again , to go back to the bottom of the right .
why don &apos;t we sing more and to get from up to a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happening ?
it &apos;s so <unk> age .
we &apos;ve been moving before the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , it &apos;s happened to be the age of age , and it &apos;s happened to happen , and it &apos;s the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens is that we can have the responsibility for our memories and the own order of our individual memories in the <unk> media .
and the book and the image .
so , we &apos;re actually a bit too far <unk> to <unk> .
virtuality is a <unk> to us from us to become <unk> for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> on the <unk> , is so far to say that these media media , he &apos;s going to be <unk> , and so on , so , that these media media has been <unk> and our ability to <unk> <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the age machine .
what does affect affect our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then the most sophisticated influences of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re over the course of the centuries , more and more <unk> , has been <unk> by the influences of the <unk> .
that means instead of remind us to find a standardized , far common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have a abstract language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing in pictures don &apos;t even in images of things , but we <unk> our language .
we used to believe that things happen linear .
and we &apos;ve been accepted as the law , and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s remained us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re still very arrested as a <unk> , very low .
the question is , what is now ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age age of <unk> , we had now <unk> this so-called <unk> .
this sounds very <unk> and sounds very science fiction .
but these concepts of the <unk> that allows us to discover this opportunity back to discover our capabilities .
it &apos;s about virtuality ; it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to talk about a little bit .
there are technological concepts like the <unk> reality , that is the extended reality .
so if you look at google , you google , you &apos;re looking at , then is a concept of what we can combine the virtual world with the real world , which is called our <unk> to the <unk> , which is going to be normal , <unk> .
another example is the world &apos;s virtual reality .
so , of course , of course , the kind of thing that may sound sound , because we &apos;re not physically in <unk> , virtual worlds , which is a <unk> model of the <unk> .
and other example , the other example is the <unk> , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a person .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated and i &apos;m hoping that video , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you can get up a minute , so you can talk to the two of the two over the project .
and this project i &apos;ve brought as an example of this project , as again , in this <unk> , cognitive models .
so , this is a game , i have to say to this .
so , of course , what the <unk> of course is extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say games , you probably have a very likely to look at eyes that people are people in front of any <unk> <unk> , or they play with some of some <unk> in the hand .
in any case they do it in it .
that &apos;s a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i think that i discover the outside the outside , so i discover the real world again .
and this game is connecting the virtual world , so the data is the <unk> that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize that i have to be so much .
you can tell you a lot better , there &apos;s more much more than it .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at which places in positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get from the city of a completely different sight , a completely different impression , which is i see the negatives and positive zones of a city and get in a very different city of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re like to look at now .
oh , what you can see here , i &apos;m sure , is a little bit of what you see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to do this , my my talk , and in the sense that the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve been acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and actually , to actually have a bit of us in the future , but actually to us back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to you to be in .
i &apos;ve been asked to be asked whether this bag is a <unk> bag and i &apos;m going to talk to .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m going to get a pretty much going on , what &apos;s inside there .
but i &apos;m just doing it even a little bit of a little bit .
yes , kids are inherently curious , or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m a designer of the house , so i &apos;m interested in , of course , with the subject of curiosity and how changed our thinking and why we &apos;re losing too well , and why it &apos;s also <unk> and so on .
so that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re going to be with the real sense of the brain as a solution .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often in the <unk> of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half .
a <unk> to the issue of natural user interface .
now you &apos;re asking questions why are the whole of the things at the way of this , <unk> <unk> of communication , interacting with the interaction and so on .
and so i just think of one of these little devices high because things are always going more efficient , increasingly , more natural , and you have to look at , what is actually , for us , of course , what &apos;s <unk> or intuitively .
and in the background , i have a <unk> interface in the area of the design , so the next generation of the human computer so dealing with the relationship with human computer , so how our devices are being able to change the digital assistant to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;m busy doing it , when &apos;s of course , or intuitively .
maybe also , you have to look at this .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a moment , we &apos;re moving now from the third of the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning of the <unk> , the <unk> .
that means you &apos;ve found that you talked a common language , you could communicate with each other , it &apos;s in other parts , cities have grown up or villages , and has created the <unk> fashion .
the <unk> was a very natural , a very natural , a very natural .
you can also learn , so no toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it &apos;s <unk> and we &apos;re of course .
that &apos;s then the way to be in the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> because , of course , the living language began to <unk> in the form of writing , which is called what <unk> and alive , i start and <unk> it in stone and so i also <unk> it .
so the way i <unk> and when i &apos;m <unk> , it &apos;s a whole different coverage of course when there is a life of life .
but then , the typeface took me as a <unk> , got it .
then the next generation , where we actually have been in the world .
this is the <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> and others .
at the time it was a <unk> where <unk> , <unk> and other people have said , are their actually crazy when the people start to read , then you want to be more <unk> .
and now we come into the next generation and exciting , so a <unk> is just a few hundred years and we &apos;re in the moment in this particular stage stage that we &apos;re going to join .
and the confused of course , because we &apos;re seeing a site of the new media , social social media , facebook and so on .
so with total transparency , which is the new thinking of what the old thinking about , don &apos;t say that in the <unk> , and no beef is more , or other phenomena , which is i want to just want to do it , and it &apos;s like to <unk> .
and these two worlds , the bubble is , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing about it is , if you look at this , these new society , these <unk> , <unk> , very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
now , not more at the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the issue is about ecology .
not , if i think local green , and your neighbor thinks less ecologically , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village , actually , a global village has become a global village with the same principles of course , as well , as well , the total transparency .
so , as you saw in the village , who knew what happened to who and when , this is what these are happening today about this extension of our own mobile <unk> at global level .
it &apos;s that we know global and and they &apos;re getting better and better .
so it was like it happened to the village , so it was happening .
so , i &apos;m going to take me to look at a way , which is because what &apos;s really , of course , what we might also have <unk> , which is , what does the difference ?
because often , they &apos;re going to be people , they can &apos;t do it <unk> so that everybody can handle with it .
so you have to deal with this , which is because it &apos;s because not just simply change it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and then , of course , as a bit of intuitively , and how can i take some of the things and so the things that they do so much as they &apos;re so intuitively , because they &apos;re just doing it and they &apos;re just going to use .
you &apos;re busy , even as a student , with the topic of perception and the <unk> .
and of course , that &apos;s what you start and look like , and says , okay , now i just look at the inside of your inner self .
and what &apos;s it in it ?
so how do we work when we <unk> ?
and what is because of course , intuitively , intuitively , how do our channels work and how do the cognitive work work ?
because steve jobs has said to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to look at the detail if i want to make something more <unk> or intuitively , what is the heart .
and there you already see that a lot of our seven senses , most of us are just about five , now , there &apos;s actually a little bit of seven , because it &apos;s probably going to be the next , and the <unk> of our self .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
by you alone , what is information ?
information is that any difference is any difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but not , but not what it &apos;s got to be in detail .
but i have to understand the heart , in the nature , when it becomes information , when will be information from data and from information , so i know , and i know how to do things as well , or can do it .
and of course , how does design influence on perception .
so , we see this , when i do things , i can shape it <unk> like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can actually design it sort of intuitive by making things .
so much of natural , in a gourd , but i see , in fact , where is salt and pepper and pepper it .
and if i say someone , you can &apos;t go off and pepper , he &apos;ll start to look at the right first of the time , where is in there .
and the left just intuitive access , and then hopefully that i hope that no sugar in there , that &apos;s salt .
but also our perception itself , how does it does that .
for example , this perception of the context .
the right is actually , the right is bigger than the little bit , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just unique to our perception , depending on what we do things like .
does anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s just more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle starts to start to relate to be certain resemblance .
and if i take a <unk> <unk> , and then we don &apos;t see it another one , and that &apos;s a one , which is a circle , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle .
it &apos;s called <unk> , or <unk> , which is influenced us in perception .
so for the designers , the most of the most of the most of the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> , the closeness , the <unk> of the continuity and so on .
and they &apos;re often forgotten in the third time .
but that &apos;s essential to be essential to , if you just want to make things accordingly , too much as well .
the next phenomenon , which is what is really interesting about this .
sounds very trite , but it &apos;s so interesting when you &apos;re getting closer with it .
so we have the eyes right now , and now you think , we &apos;re seeing from the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see from the back of the back .
and they &apos;re an assumption , and they &apos;re looking at the front of the front of what you can recognize , <unk> circle .
that &apos;s called the <unk> , we just see what we see , again , again , again , in our <unk> , to say , okay , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok , ok ,
i &apos;ve so much cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got a <unk> of what you want to see .
that &apos;s then , then , again , it goes back .
and again , it goes back again because the back of the front of the front , and the back , and says , well , please , please , please , and you &apos;re sure what you see , is what you see , is what you can see .
and then it goes back to back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , a very , very sophisticated process , how certain things are happening and what they &apos;re happening for <unk> things happen .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody is trying to see something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to see what &apos;s going to see .
does someone look at a particular thing ?
a <unk> , right .
so if i &apos;ve seen that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know that .
they will never forget anymore because i &apos;m showing where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , you always see it .
that &apos;s what i did is actually <unk> that you don &apos;t see any patterns of <unk> , but i &apos;ve always got them in a very short time , and again , in this <unk> picture .
and this is this projection of vision , <unk> , seeing .
now i &apos;m now , and now i &apos;m going to see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray is not actually not , but here in this <unk> mass of these are so accordingly .
does anybody know what three seconds ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
and if i know , a little bit about three seconds , until i kind of <unk> into the <unk> , then i can also bridge a very well <unk> bridge where i &apos;m going to do with a three seconds .
that &apos;s what it has to process it than present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegantly <unk> to the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what is <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also an exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you &apos;re in love with in love .
that means , again , if you know , you know , who you like a long time , because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what you could happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also an exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the most of most sensations we have .
so , this is the first idea of it is going to fast speed at the way we perceive things .
and as we can see things , we see things we &apos;re looking at , and how we are also <unk> ourselves accordingly .
of course , the creator of not only have to do with the topic of perceptions , neural <unk> , but mostly , with the subject of the <unk> .
so , like a human talk is accordingly .
so there &apos;s a function of information , so that &apos;s so delicate things or <unk> things .
there &apos;s <unk> where i know exactly where i have to grasp .
there &apos;s symbolic functions , why is somebody in such a little <unk> , where virtually no matter of what <unk> , so <unk> sums of money , even though it &apos;s not so much as much ?
we &apos;re more like the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we &apos;re also concerned about , of course , of course .
back to my actual subject of natural user interface , and the subject of course , is <unk> .
<unk> means always , how can i make a certain goal or how can you make a certain sense of effective in a particular field of effective , efficiently and <unk> a goal .
that &apos;s what &apos;s like the norm .
how can i make something more like the ?
can i need this directly to control or i need to do it directly , i need an <unk> manual .
and less <unk> or <unk> .
now i &apos;m just making it differently and beautiful , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and if you have seen the software that we &apos;ve seen on it , you can also see why <unk> percent of our current today is intuitively intuitively intuitively , and not in the <unk> processes , which is <unk> in many areas or <unk> , although it &apos;s already more intuitive than classical software .
and this is intuitive <unk> not only since apple &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> fundamental <unk> , if i want to make the technological devices that you want to use .
why ?
because in the rule we &apos;re in through these new kind of <unk> , so the natural user user , for example , are five times faster on the average of our goal .
so you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classic <unk> , five hours and with this new kind of natural software only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home with four hours , but you &apos;re going to hire your employers , or someone else , you know , as he &apos;s busy with the four hours accordingly .
but i want to say that it &apos;s because of course , is an effective <unk> , also , to make certain things .
so if we &apos;re entering the field of software , here , the first <unk> of <unk> interfaces that were very abstract , where you &apos;ve taken months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , the next one , which is already <unk> neural model , like the software <unk> , and we &apos;ve been working on a notion of something that &apos;s metaphor to make the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer .
so not more zeros and they &apos;re ones , or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
that &apos;s all the whole thing that we &apos;ve done this whole thing is a lot better , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of the <unk> <unk> works has been working very much more related to behave .
so , i mean , as a <unk> , i mean , as a <unk> , the behavior is what they look like .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
that in once , that &apos;s always the same thing for the success , the <unk> of a app .
and if i &apos;m going to take a step into these natural user interfaces where i &apos;m in a voice by language , by language , by <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> the things , i &apos;m still going faster and yet .
but then , that leads me again to the point , when are the things that are more intuitive ?
now , if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to get back to my little friend here and see , and you have to see what &apos;s the way from view of the <unk> , when &apos;s now really intuitively ?
and that &apos;s a lot of people , is always a little bit of intuitively , if i have to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s just going to do it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means if we look at the existing <unk> of one in something else , for example , the metaphor can i do this as a designer of the machine .
that means , i can use this an intuitive , human <unk> on a software and so making the software significantly more <unk> .
now , of course , the question of course , what is actually the most <unk> <unk> of us , and now i &apos;m .
that &apos;s what called <unk> .
that &apos;s using us and <unk> is an acronym and orient , <unk> , inform , <unk> .
and that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s doing all of you all of you all of you , but it &apos;s subconscious and so , and it &apos;s kind of intuitively instinctively , and also instinctively .
the model is already <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in the world and old , and it &apos;s used for us all the time , without the most that we &apos;ve been there .
<unk> <unk> is about 50 to the <unk> times of us ever , so in your sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s going to be more <unk> than the day .
i can now orient this mental <unk> , <unk> , inform <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and in this kind of human-to-human , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , now , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of the <unk> than the human transmission of the most classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and as i &apos;m now , for example , i &apos;m going to orient as <unk> <unk> , <unk> as a selection , which is where it comes to me , i can take it anywhere , and you can buy it , and you can buy it , and so on .
and then i can transmit it all .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
now , everybody has eaten a pie .
so , in the way , i &apos;m going to sort of sort of interact with the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i can filter this whole overview , it can be able to this this now , and can tell me all the things with chocolate .
and once again , a interface , which is a much more efficient and very much natural natural .
because that i can reach the things like the lens , and it can come to me , is much more natural than the <unk> organized websites or other mechanisms can make these things available .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i also want to close to end up and even again , and also , a way to think differently , to get to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much .
i want to give you a certain aspect of curiosity .
the first thing when you become a child &apos;s a baby than a baby , is that what you do you have , right ? and depending on the way , whether their parents allow you to play , and the more , the more , their curiosity will actually do naturally .
and the curiosity don &apos;t do not learn .
so , all of those are the ones who are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to do it now , basically this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years , in quality of it .
and there is a central dot .
and that &apos;s based on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day they give a + order to add two grams of phosphorus and every day they have to absorb a phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have a bone .
we could just glide as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we did not take a phosphorus and make them .
and it &apos;s so that we &apos;re so that we &apos;re here with something that &apos;s actually <unk> , but not that &apos;s like that .
because all of the things that are about energy , but no one is talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have the phosphorus and already , for two years , and now , by the world &apos;s most more uranium in the world , is actually used to be used in the environment as in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years alone , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> in our fields have been distributed in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing all .
it &apos;s <unk> with children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment is going to be <unk> .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s like , as i would say , your child is , it just only three times five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , our entire world , we would be a <unk> .
so , the way of the <unk> to think of the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first thing .
in the ground is over <unk> percent of the <unk> .
at the moment we &apos;re building corn and losing pounds of 30 pounds per hectare per hectare , or on the square meter .
that means we lose the same about five times more than new times more than new .
and of course , we can look at this <unk> .
and it &apos;s all packaging or content .
in <unk> , for example , in the <unk> , 30 percent of the <unk> has been <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , they will be the <unk> .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby takes about six thousand <unk> .
of course , we could reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in a second in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to this <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted by the <unk> .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is what is it , right ?
we need an average thing we think in the world we have too much in the world .
and if you &apos;re when you &apos;re the people who you find it out of the people , if you say it would be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone says , like al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> to stabilize as the human population .
in israel , you say , if you <unk> a human human , you <unk> the earth .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , is we really too much ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of ants on earth , then the ants weigh more four times more than we .
i could also hold termites too , but in the united states , no one likes termites in so far though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that ants weigh more than we .
and because they work much tougher than we work and because they &apos;re only three to six months of life , they &apos;re equivalent to your weight , in your weight , you &apos;re something about <unk> billion people .
that is , we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where do we really get away from what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can see , that we &apos;re seeing , that , for example , you &apos;d like to be <unk> here , you know , yes ?
you can only be <unk> if they don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only one .
did you see a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that is , what is that the whole intelligence means that we want to be as a tree , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
happiness doesn &apos;t , yes ?
there is no <unk> in trees .
there are still six billion trees alone in the world world alone .
and you &apos;ve heard of this stuff from the trees from trees ?
that means , all of our intelligence means that we want to be as a tree .
and where you see yourself in something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , it allows us to go back to the own .
every year we lose so three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back into the order .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s how we feel so guilty of the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you &apos;re all the hot that allow our own <unk> back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our environmental footprint , but it &apos;s about being a great footprint , that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but if it &apos;s about the environment , the highest thing is , it &apos;s not to be there ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot yourself , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it different .
we can get our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing brazil in brazil where we get the nutrients .
we can &apos;t quite look at this way nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we take right now .
in china , a <unk> is a <unk> today , sort of , like , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means the whole western <unk> of the <unk> of that the city has always taken , but the farmers never have been returned .
so , the cities had to grow more because the farmers were going to go and go to the cities , and the cities had to keep getting their nutrients .
so all of the western empires are always expanding , until they don &apos;t get the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done it <unk> civilization over five years because it was able to be able to <unk> nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat , they &apos;re expected to eat it until you go to the bathroom .
because it &apos;s <unk> , to go and take nutrients .
you have them to eat them for food , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see the internet , how to get nutrients .
and it &apos;s really beautiful about it , if you do this , agriculture is , in a hectare of land , with five people in favelas , so that a hectare of land can make about <unk> dollars , so that &apos;s a farmer and ducks and <unk> and fish and fish .
and the great thing is that the <unk> is in the favelas of over the favelas around the favelas .
so we don &apos;t need to control people to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
we can support them , well .
this is , of course , <unk> , but the plants are carrying themselves .
the oil byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by design , which is a farmer to be able to .
that &apos;s called the <unk> .
and none of these plants , we &apos;ve been built over <unk> in the last twenty years , none of these plants have ever been <unk> .
they could just be able to be a liter of a liter and then it would be ruining the plant .
not that .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people that we &apos;re very bad at the way .
we can support them , well .
that means we need to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , write it in germany , in germany , is the best use of all the treatment treatment in the <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> , you know , a little bit of help .
because the <unk> plant is the best one to the phosphorus .
and that has to be back .
we see that the phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s absolutely .
we &apos;ve been used in the <unk> of the year .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is the <unk> <unk> .
but we need the overall overall .
you know , there are two countries that are going to control nearly 70 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of the <unk> control .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace is through other energy energy .
but the phosphorus is not replace .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing making a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making things right .
and it &apos;s all about questions about what the right thing is .
that is to think about efficiency , not to efficiencies .
of course , in holland , you understand that light because in holland is the land on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you have them , and they come to 50 .
completely inefficient .
but all of it , right ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six <unk> three pounds of their lives .
that .
this is not a scientific way that we don &apos;t know , because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to do it .
but a <unk> , even in that lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s effective , and effective , right ?
one of all of things in life is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient .
that &apos;s not about resource efficiency , but efficiency .
so , what is the right ?
not , the <unk> is a little bit better and to burn it and so <unk> and in the <unk> all the materials for the plants , but first of the questions , how do you include the road ?
imagine mozart .
yes ?
when i go to dinner , and i say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot;
that &apos;s efficient .
all of the life is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient .
if you fall in love with someone ?
yes ?
that is , everything that matters in life is not to avoid , to avoid , to reduce .
the whole <unk> .
we say , &quot; oh , you know , you don &apos;t have green green in the south .
no , that &apos;s just the right thing , yes ?
every place where you &apos;re looking at , you know , you can get back again .
but the wrong things .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
we think about north .
there is every footprint in the ground .
when you &apos;re running , yes , everybody destroys footprint .
because the soil is going to die off the mosses , and the water and water is the the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint , which is a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we &apos;re going to be in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do so with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s the minimum of the minimum .
so not saving , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy like the people in the high bow so that you don &apos;t get out of the car .
because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> mechanism that &apos;s a <unk> , which is a liquid .
you can see where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building it everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants that they &apos;re doing that just to change in the diversity .
that is , we &apos;re valuable , not less harmful .
so we have two different cycles .
not all of all of of course <unk> be <unk> .
so a tv machine , or a washing machine , they just use it , you don &apos;t .
just the things that <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , the ones that have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only used to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
so direct ads , and it doesn &apos;t have <unk> by the company , but it &apos;s because they &apos;re going to help this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do not do things anymore .
yes ?
so , if i say it <unk> for food , and i say that &apos;s free of <unk> , then you don &apos;t really care about it .
no , we &apos;re stuck what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so , not like <unk> .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all in it , is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can see the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , and the rubber <unk> can go to the rubber in biological <unk> .
everything is <unk> .
and if it works , of course , it &apos;s really , of course , for <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of the world &apos;s most <unk> globally , which is caused by the textile industry .
so , you &apos;re helping them with , ask you guys .
hey , <unk> , do you really serious ?
because the <unk> has already changed the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure if they really <unk> .
so , you &apos;re going to help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s about .
yeah .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been shown .
that &apos;s going .
we can do things now that they do , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see in biological <unk> .
technical equipment loops are the same .
there is a direct direct .
this is the first green pack , actually , it &apos;s done for the cycle .
so , again , in every store , you can make things <unk> .
if you get to that , right ?
remember the earth still ?
if you &apos;re the waste of the moment .
all of these <unk> are <unk> .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the front of the <unk> , but even in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> inside , you can go back to <unk> , then you can go back to a baby in israel , or in tunisia <unk> trees .
yes ?
if you take these same , you take them , they <unk> , sterile and the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s <unk> for all of the life , already in the beginning .
so , we need not <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , it &apos;s like .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can do anything even yet .
i founded a institute .
in the way , there are a lot of people working with and you can all get into them .
there is a way to do it , <unk> , where everybody can join .
so no longer save , avoid , avoid , not a <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does it matter ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as language .
so , in the description of my talk is that i was to be a <unk> , i think , as a <unk> , so i understand english .
<unk> is the written in the written notes in <unk> music .
that as a translator is that when i don &apos;t just <unk> the word for the word text into another language , but also the deeper sense of the words and <unk> , it needs to understand a meaningful translation , anyone who has to do with <unk> .
already , in the english , you know , you can &apos;t know , much as it happens when it &apos;s about poetry , or to talk about poetry .
it &apos;s a little bit of alien to what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just have the written by the written notes .
you know that the composer has all <unk> in the notes that he has imagined .
in reality , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about equally as well as a <unk> , like a verbal , albeit a very seemingly <unk> description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of smell not too smell , the degree of the <unk> is not to see the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel not .
that means that the role has to have this <unk> data in the <unk> of the <unk> , which is <unk> , which is <unk> , correlates , non-verbal <unk> .
now i want to tell you what i translate is in radical , so <unk> , even once in a verbal language .
so , in a way , a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to do it , i &apos;d rather to do it in an german , because if i could have to translate into english into english , it would be equivalent to translation of translation in translation .
so , the music is like the same way that the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes , the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to be so much to learn reading notes and the to the piano and the right place to hit a <unk> .
so that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to draw .
the meaning of letters you can see when you can get language .
and so you need to use music for the music to the music for the same way for the spoken .
there &apos;s also <unk> whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passively , or to speak , until the musical officials .
the work of the <unk> is the same way that the one <unk> .
after first , you &apos;ve chosen a piece of a bit , because you &apos;re excited about , you &apos;re all about the other way of the composition .
you collect information about the piece of the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers even .
you studied the works that he &apos;s before and after .
you can compare .
the <unk> , it &apos;s to write .
how did he believes ?
how were his life , how the society and the politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in me .
you think in this time , by example , looking at contemporary images or literature .
but the interpreter of the time , but as the interpreter of the interpreter , the interpreter of a lot of the world you play over and it &apos;s always easier to feel that in your <unk> and feel .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend you live together .
his cause to write the piece , more and more and more to my personal concerns , it &apos;s going to play .
now , the notes is all different than a detailed record of the universe of composers , but it &apos;s just a framework , turn it back to the point of it , to make sense , and meaning to <unk> .
and i &apos;m saying to my own words , what could be written by that framework .
i &apos;m playing <unk> , which could be able to be able to be a games .
now for me , and for the composers of the time , and what you might mean for it today .
every sound , every tone , every single idea makes sense because i feel it myself , because it comes from my now personal .
it has to be <unk> for me , and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve done so long as well as new as well .
as you &apos;ve been new experienced new day , although the same rituals of life , you have , they have , their <unk> , to work , so , i will keep the same thing back to new .
i &apos;ve become older , again , a day , seasons , my pulse is slowed down at night than the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer to return back home .
i guess the audience breathing the audience , it consciously , or subconsciously .
all of all of that affects me and all of all of the influences , and that &apos;s my experience with composition .
and so wonderful , if i &apos;m standing with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea and immediately it will be this answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we don &apos;t have <unk> and whatever you can &apos;t do .
it makes great fun to make music , and they have seen the audience , like the music is alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like this moment .
i can &apos;t play today as well as in twenty years .
so , i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to have a much more more <unk> , more than more <unk> , emotions and emotions as today .
certainly , i &apos;m going to have a few of <unk> , but it &apos;s new <unk> .
i &apos;m a nice example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> at my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a known <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a long professor of the <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young so that he had been <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky , and he was very early on the age of age , and i was to meet in my classes , and so i was in high school .
i was back at the time 17 , when i was in a class , and played the last of the four of four verses of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what was the introduction of this <unk> for me .
that &apos;s a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he said , and he said , so ?
that &apos;s what needs to be the <unk> .
because for me , it means .
he was already about 60 .
well , with 17 , you &apos;re still , but no significant memories .
i &apos;m going to play this for all the few years now , and it &apos;s still , for me , even though not have a single grade .
every time it &apos;s exciting because again i &apos;m going to read something new .
an example of a whole different area , and boeing has painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , in <unk> light .
he translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as they saw in this moment .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is like this .
now , i &apos;ve also been also older than chopin , with the chopin , when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s lived for a half years ago .
and it &apos;s important to me again , again , to look back in the notes , even if i think you memorized .
to keep <unk> , right , with the composers .
because the notes are the only link to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start to talk to the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need to have about spoken for about the spoken for the spoken .
often , the <unk> is so that you &apos;re just going to learn the notes .
you &apos;re actually learning to read this first before you &apos;re just a word .
you learn to find the notes to the instrument .
and if all of your fingers and right , as it is in the notes , then sounds coming out , they sound like music .
when the exact trajectory , the students get the <unk> piece .
and it &apos;s hardly talking about interpretation of interpretation .
well , there &apos;s well , there &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , f and b , et , etc .
most of the most here .
but also , if you put these data , it &apos;s still something that &apos;s not even done .
and yet it &apos;s always a interpretation of interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you &apos;re often completely <unk> .
namely , to make music on the instrument that your own musical do and feel like to be there .
that &apos;s what they sing .
a child who didn &apos;t have learned because it &apos;s not <unk> , because it &apos;s not going to do it from themselves .
that &apos;s like the <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experience and the idea of music to have another possibility to make a tool , to sound .
people who never sang , have never been able to feel immediately with your own body , like it &apos;s to form a sound .
an magic <unk> with his own breath .
the instrument instrument is , namely , the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , and they were dancing , and dance and feet to dance .
so the <unk> is the <unk> of my fingers .
the melody is coming from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> nowadays .
you don &apos;t need to make music even if it &apos;s a boring .
no longer need to whistling whistling .
every single music is going to be <unk> when you &apos;re all <unk> out of the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i don &apos;t sing ?
i &apos;m going to do , you can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they cannot sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to find out whether they can &apos;t yet , or learn how to do these little muscles , the vocal chords , right .
this is what you can train .
or c , because you have them <unk> it &apos;s <unk> .
so , i &apos;m thinking , how fermi fermi was this diagnosis ?
did you put a <unk> or <unk> , how to say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music and so they don &apos;t want to do with no failure .
but what i would regret is because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
so , you see , you see , all cases nobody has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t you please , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m sure , but certainly you can tell you whether it like you or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s taste me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t eat it for food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music because they don &apos;t play .
listen to them , and tell you whether it tastes you or not .
whether music is to be to be <unk> or sweet .
tell you what they &apos;re feeling .
and with the time they &apos;re also , they can &apos;t , and you want to taste something more spices , or taste fine differences .
why am i urge to the audience now that it &apos;s also going to be in the way ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of art you &apos;ve never look at , has no force to work .
the food that was cooked by a cook or a chef , it has to be eaten and not just looked at the recipes .
so , please hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
when in a environments where the adult act is going to be active or at least the music , a child , and then it &apos;s very easy to a <unk> , to ask , what color does your flower ?
can you play me in the blue ?
and the kid is playing , instead of a <unk> , instead of having a blue flower .
and this sounds like before .
so that was the first beginning of a single musical expression .
so the first step to interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of today that &apos;s originally written a hundred , before <unk> , or from three years ago , it &apos;s been written by three years ago ?
now the instruments have <unk> .
there was a <unk> state of the instrument even even the instrument .
it was just not invented yet .
i think the bach &apos;s really excited if he had the most powerful possibilities that we had to have done in modern <unk> .
i can take the <unk> that the stream has had to sound on the modern wing of the sound , which is a <unk> <unk> .
also , by beethoven , you know he was more deaf than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that &apos;s a orchestra of the time as <unk> .
so the composers of the composers of us have to do that the pieces again .
so they &apos;re <unk> , which is actually just imagined in the spirit .
and also , what you would think in the spirit today .
or that , what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
were you <unk> ?
and how did that feel like ?
suck .
i have a friend who drive a <unk> .
so when i come up with my little v w , and i came back to my little v , and i &apos;m going to get this feeling .
i did something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what needs you need to do so the n of big car ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re in the first year , half of its value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i afford to afford to do a small car ?
and then i &apos;ll immediately get a , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward sensation .
our organism is a great way to make these inconvenient emotions like envy simply to disappear .
you can also try to try and <unk> or <unk> or something like that .
i want to explain to you today , or something that you &apos;re unconscious is familiar with .
the mechanism is from a lie .
but remember , not as you may not have heard of the lie , if people say , nobody has the intention of the human .
and then rocks <unk> , so he &apos;s the <unk> .
in a lie , you see that the liars even don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes <unk> light easy to see that it has different in mind .
it &apos;s just just simplistic and not even <unk> .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about what is to do with it that they deceive themselves .
they need this lie to get a <unk> to get a railway upright .
they can get less easy , yes , <unk> , or to collapse .
they need time .
now , by this time , one anecdote that you might know .
spanish painter <unk> once a woman <unk> .
this woman complained afterwards , the portrait would not see her .
picasso says , wait for it .
it will always be more similar .
and if you laugh , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn to find something that artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist divides them something with , and especially this lady , which doesn &apos;t see if you just look in the mirror .
the artist divides them in a portrait of a portrait you &apos;re just familiar with , if you look at this artwork .
then this awkward sensation , it may not look like this , and it &apos;s always more similar .
here &apos;s what you have this mechanism with which we can use a great invention of the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , even in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories it comes back .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning , and he asked him , who is , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror is , there &apos;s this mirror , yeah , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true inform , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true value of value .
but we should just do familiar with that you can &apos;t tell you that there &apos;s a woman somewhere somewhere else .
here it is necessary that we need to understand the <unk> of <unk> , wherever again .
we need this in this point that lie to us , which is <unk> , without the time we can &apos;t live .
we don &apos;t just lie in the art , but in science , in science , and that &apos;s such a great lie .
and there is this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , which is the origin of species and the lineage of the human ancestry .
that man should be the monkeys and , yes , it &apos;s at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her man and she said , this is not true , what charles is writing .
human beings should have been about the monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent the people of knowledge of it .
why do we need to think that people else can get something else if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without life without these .
because we &apos;re this <unk> , this feeling great , the lineage of the highest creatures , not from one such <unk> , from such a <unk> , which is still comparable , and it &apos;s a stone , and it &apos;s like the things that it is for us .
so , we can &apos;t have this stuff .
we need to prevent people to figure out of things , especially if they &apos;re true .
so , you see , how slowly this mechanism on , and how the tracks look at , which is leaving , that &apos;s a little different , as a of us , i want to see a story of this .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife tells me .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to him , because he &apos;s a tilt to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire brigade .
and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re <unk> at this point . there &apos;s nothing wrong .
i said i said , &quot; i always said a human <unk> in a moral matrix because it &apos;s used to be able to replace it through the <unk> .
and then they do it and then you know the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the periphery .
so a little <unk> , which is not interested in the <unk> .
the interest in the <unk> .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can see , where you learn how to get fire .
there is just the second second , the firemen .
he &apos;s signed up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t tell his teacher , you can &apos;t see it somewhere , and you &apos;re happy to be happy when the fire afterwards afterwards .
no , it &apos;s just a much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers that others only can only do if they put fire .
here &apos;s this little mechanism here .
this <unk> that this particular <unk> that was already known that in the heart of the <unk> has already knew that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t tell .
here &apos;s what you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious point immediately , without you to do something about it , and the things you know that they can do quite different , that they can sound much better for them and other .
so , just like this words that we also use in language of the politically <unk> chatter .
actually , we know that something else is .
but we know , if we say this , the social terms are very sensitive to it .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to be able to work things like this , to present .
so i want to show you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after what logic of deception , these <unk> , the willingness to be a different reality of the unconscious , that it &apos;s <unk> to spread out outside .
i want to give you two , maybe you &apos;re going to give you three examples .
so the first example of what many of you are familiar with and some of you don &apos;t value at all of all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so benign , he says about a <unk> .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t be <unk> , physical nature .
and when you have people in front of themselves , the confidence are they have a soul , or you can also tell you that you can also say that you &apos;ve been given from the soul to life , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and from that soul , you think they somehow think of this nature of nature , in this particular nature , <unk> , it &apos;s the latin latin , the <unk> , your mind .
and if that <unk> then goes over to the people , it &apos;s filled with the spirit , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s how the idea of how the soul works .
so you should get out of the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to be able to be able to be present as something that &apos;s going to be present for our lives .
and if you have this condition , you know , you know the logic , which we &apos;re going to be able to improve in the happiness , through a lie to improve .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
you know , you know , from school .
now this is a <unk> that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here &apos;s something that &apos;s logic , but also the willingness to lie .
namely , they can easily be able to use these logic .
in this <unk> , three sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> , said there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if the <unk> is right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;m in particular foyer here .
a third sentence that immediately might have people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
the ones that you don &apos;t have soul , who &apos;s dead and cannot be saying anything .
and here &apos;s it &apos;s already .
here &apos;s this logic , in this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you immediately see it .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical correct .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell the things about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t quite quite , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just true .
so if he says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our <unk> consciousness is immediately , it can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that nothing with nothing with the first two sentences and the first two sentences that &apos;s like , as if the opposite of the first sentence already already been proven and so on .
because actually , we have to prove whether it &apos;s soul or not .
but with this logic that it uses it &apos;s a simple sentences that are <unk> correctly , and a third <unk> of <unk> that looks like , so that we can save our <unk> .
so , we &apos;re doing as if it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things on different examples .
in about , we have a whole modern example of about , that &apos;s always <unk> the <unk> .
so , this is another <unk> topic , a <unk> of philosophy to mind .
so that &apos;s what it has to do with it , that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was an <unk> who was called johannes <unk> and after that was named <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s made of nature of nature .
that &apos;s not the soul .
that &apos;s a <unk> .
and if you put the exact exact middle between two <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he &apos;s supposed to go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the <unk> are introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happens .
just if you get another example , so if you get to make a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and even nothing to do .
automatically , he &apos;s going to be the right idea .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , it will be <unk> , from the larger pile that would put a straight , they also have a little bit that it has to be able to give a free will .
and if we also have a <unk> in <unk> , then i remember the <unk> for brain research .
there is an <unk> that &apos;s wolf <unk> , and he says sometimes you know , wolf <unk> claims , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can bring back to the second sentence , and can say if wolf has a right right , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read in the daily classroom , which is going to find in this third sentence .
and the one of the things that looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , too , can &apos;t be able to be able to support his actions and claims to the <unk> and <unk> , and he &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , you can do it again .
actually , you know , you know , it &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do as if the first sentence sentence is wrong , as you would not think the opposite of the opposite .
and now you can just do if you want to do anything if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to practice .
practice for example , if you can meet a person who you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please , not to use german word for <unk> , that &apos;s called the prophet .
they don &apos;t want to call it , that would be a little bit more politically <unk> .
tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;ll be able to see one of them , for granted , you know , that &apos;s not evidence .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re dealing with it , they don &apos;t prove to prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , is the man .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he has led them to a <unk> , where he doesn &apos;t even decrease themselves .
because in fact , that man is not interested in fact .
it &apos;s just interested in itself , even <unk> , the need to prove there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the way of the <unk> of the <unk> is the brilliance of lie .
and once you once again , a way that have a way to feel that <unk> , people , do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember them .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed to give myself if i could say it .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here , and i asked me whether i could hold a talk here and my idea of value .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , it fell to talk about my idea .
and may i think maybe my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s the sum of all , of course , all of many ideas .
i &apos;m one one of the two , are the two nice girl , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that has been made for this bad <unk> image because i &apos;ve already started studying engineering engineering , <unk> , engineering school , and i think , &quot;
and i then went back to berlin , and i was <unk> for renewable energy , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the secretary of the time , the <unk> was called <unk> .
the <unk> is <unk> .
because a good engineer is either built to be great cars , or <unk> .
but it &apos;s like the n of <unk> , from a little hundred watts of the square meter out of the square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin , it was a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m the most grateful that he &apos;s got the word again again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t have to use the word , because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the <unk> years .
and there was so that there was <unk> <unk> and one of them sitting in <unk> in the <unk> where you were doing evil .
the place of the <unk> , but it was called <unk> and wind and the solar engine and i started in the <unk> .
and yeah , a lot of what i said today , because many , many beautiful statements were that i &apos;ve been in .
i &apos;ve been working for a <unk> , and i was <unk> that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one of no , the <unk> was the <unk> , which has a completely <unk> . i &apos;ve been a very much <unk> , i &apos;m going to have a really really <unk> of a <unk> , because all of my father &apos;s colleagues , you have a <unk> , you have the money to the window .
it &apos;s bothering there .
and that was really very , very , very , very , and you can get a picture in the way that i asked myself about 10 years , a thousand <unk> , who were still , of course , is that the really great thing that it is to be great .
and then i went to <unk> <unk> , and then we have become <unk> of the company that were then with the <unk> <unk> one of the largest <unk> in the world .
but one of the <unk> , but also , we have the problem of the growing company , and we have <unk> , a little group , decided that we &apos;re going to start back to be small and then , and that &apos;s what the nonsense is not , we &apos;re talking about .
and so , i brought you a project i brought to you now now .
and the title of my presentation was , yes , how to get too 100 percent renewable .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where could you have a memory of making a lot of money today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s a four four four four four four .
now , the renewables today has been 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
that &apos;s just technological .
when you <unk> more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
i always tell the politicians when they &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we &apos;re in europe seven percent , and our network is physically physically in the european .
if we had 20 percent , we have already have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple : the things that was <unk> , the first contacts started with the island , and actually , if you can just go through .
how big should be so a battery that &apos;s going to be so a battery so that you have to be in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go again .
the conventional system sees it all over the world .
by the way , a hundred <unk> electrical output on the world , in the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear power nuclear power plants , because that &apos;s all about all over the way .
the world &apos;s <unk> of the world is being erased with diesel because you don &apos;t need approved .
that &apos;s going fast .
you put it like a box .
and then it looks like that .
in the run , three of the <unk> , two will always wait for .
yeah , so there &apos;s a load of the bottom .
we also get very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or a system , which can only be <unk> in tiny amounts of here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the diesel is going to be <unk> and the wind , the sun , the load of the load of the load of the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the output at the moment , you have to turn off the diesel .
that &apos;s called the moment that you have to worry about the renewable energy so that &apos;s going to take over the whole net .
and you can only do , of course , if you &apos;re going to be a way of them .
that &apos;s not what one of the world is done .
so that &apos;s a small way , so you can also use your <unk> on a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you do is actually , what &apos;s going on in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what it goes .
but if you want to put multiple of these <unk> , and they should build a network , it becomes very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get 70 to three percent of renewable , and then there &apos;s another rest of the rest of the last 10 , 20 percent renewable renewable , which is going to work , and it doesn &apos;t work that they &apos;re doing it .
that &apos;s what it is going to be an energy energy that then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , that will be .
they then have to go and go to a <unk> and <unk> and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going to be with a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far you get from all ?
and then they did a whole lot of simulation .
and they have wind and the <unk> and the <unk> and came to the conclusion , an exciting thing that you need to do in about 50 cents a <unk> , about 50 cents a <unk> <unk> , about <unk> cents .
that was the first computations on six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , if the average <unk> goes up five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would all be done ?
have to negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to build a society again .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we &apos;re still doing other percent with diesel and also a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that the <unk> of the island , it &apos;s been , we find quite great .
but we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that the technical problem can solve .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we sort of the <unk> of the island in the island of the island of the island of the island of the island of the island .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for , for the largest battery of the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> is her in the &apos; 70s , &apos; bbc <unk> , today <unk> , and then they were then <unk> into the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has to do a megawatts of megawatts , and it can bring this output , and that &apos;s the battery we &apos;re going to have <unk> <unk> .
and then they put it up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as it stands up in the hall , actually , in fact , the entire dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall , it &apos;s the whole <unk> that we can simulate the network .
here we can simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable to actually put the <unk> on the web .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> onto the net .
here we see this again , we see this again again again , again , all the , individual <unk> .
and what we did since the <unk> was done , until the <unk> was done until the <unk> of the building , basically everything between the individual system at electronics , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject of the time and the subject of the whole thing , and it &apos;s all between .
and you need to communicate to battery , of course , you have to communicate to the network , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is about that you &apos;re basically , basically , the <unk> can be able to get the <unk> of problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how will go back and <unk> , <unk> , like this , we have to <unk> percent of <unk> to 30 percent of <unk> , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> is then <unk> .
so , <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate on the island to integrate more , <unk> , you can manage the load .
that means if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through &apos; n <unk> , you can do , yes , you should also do any case , the percentage of <unk> , but you will never get to complete completely .
and that &apos;s the message that &apos;s like .
so many people come and look at this , because you can see , because you can see what &apos;s problems you get .
if we turn off the diesel , you &apos;re not going to see a spinning mass , which causes a certain amount of activity in the network .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just out of louder rotating masses of large <unk> , where the wave is resembles all around europe .
we look in this web , the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s going to be nine hertz , and we &apos;re going to start a few <unk> <unk> , then we &apos;re going to get a little bit more <unk> , then we come back .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly detailed .
if you put it anywhere , it takes a long time .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable stable .
and in time you can react again .
if you don &apos;t have this , this rotating mass , they have to replace the <unk> and <unk> .
and we can actually have a huge battery two milliseconds of times .
and there &apos;s what huge <unk> there is .
and the message is , we have to have to have to be massive amounts of getting , if we were going to live in 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to achieve at all .
we then have to break our <unk> capacity down in the net .
<unk> is simply simply going to go to keep the gas station to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a <unk> moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t have otherwise , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not .
and we just try to make them that you can get the capacity to grow the capacity , the <unk> capacity , to bring them to the network .
fortunately , fortunately , there are a whole lot of studies .
and so , to this purpose , people always come and look at our <unk> on the , sort of our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can go to a little bit of the future .
and many discussions , which i had been in the last six years , the same way that i &apos;ve been in the last 30 years , the subject of <unk> .
it &apos;s there is there , there &apos;s no <unk> , we &apos;ve never have to figure out .
we have <unk> <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just just just take it out that we &apos;re going to be able to store the same capacity for the same capacity for the world in the world .
just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s so much of <unk> and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years , that the scientists are going on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million <unk> , too , too , too , too , too <unk> <unk> now .
this is going to take place in the next april .
so , you also notice that there is a change in the place , and it &apos;s just to be the idea of this <unk> , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable attack is right .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far as a discussion , it &apos;s always trying to do this <unk> , which is <unk> , which have a little bit of a net that has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is just , if they totally totally separate , or <unk> <unk> , which will be <unk> anywhere in the world and to give them <unk> , they &apos;re an island .
they just use it yet , which is the sun and the wind is where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;re told , the energy use .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in the way , the talk is the talk about <unk> <unk> , that you can be able to use a collective and energy , here &apos;s a little bit .
and yeah , i want to just encourage you to just do in the sense that you can be quiet and a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty much <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , one day , by los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless who had just been on a violin that had just two strings .
many of you will know the story , because of <unk> articles , and that was a book that was <unk> , with robert <unk> and <unk> <unk> , as steve lopez , and his <unk> career , and his <unk> career , and his <unk> career was a <unk> <unk> .
nathaniel left himself , <unk> , a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i &apos;m encouraging to read the <unk> book , and you can see the film , so you can &apos;t understand the wonderful bond between these two men , but also , the way that it allows us to be the instrument , and how they &apos;re allowed to get nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he just heard a demonstration first of the <unk> first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking about a very <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the yo-yo and hillary clinton and on how the dodgers never would be able to do in the <unk> passage of the <unk> unified symphony .
we came to speak to music , and a few days later , i got an email , where was that nathaniel was interested in me was interested in me .
i have to mention that nathaniel had a medical treatment because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and handcuffed , a trauma that has been haunted his whole life .
and as a result , it &apos;s very susceptible to these schizophrenics , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and it disappears down for days , in the streets of <unk> row , always <unk> , and the horror of his own minds .
and in fact , nathaniel was <unk> when we were talking with our first class in walt disney hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and didn &apos;t have lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and over the way somebody wanted to poison in their sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with the violin , and that i started talking about scale and <unk> and the other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing with play .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , that in <unk> eyes , i fell in <unk> eyes a total change in the front of themselves .
it was like he stood under the impact of a authentic medicine , a chemical reaction , that was a catalyst .
<unk> <unk> anger transforms in understanding , and a calm curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracle he took his violin , and began to play some snippets of <unk> <unk> , and i would ask me to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , starting to talk about <unk> , which is <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he &apos;s not just a <unk> knowledge of music , but it also connected to her personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i just know about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by music , he was talking about music , was <unk> , <unk> mann , who moved out from los angeles from los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , superb , <unk> in a <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
so , in nathaniel &apos;s great emotional health .
because the music allows him to do , and you have a lot of and delusions of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he <unk> <unk> the <unk> states .
i understand that exactly that is the nature of art .
so , this is why we &apos;re doing music , so we &apos;re doing something that we &apos;re in the inside , our emotions , through our own , through the lens , through the <unk> lens , really can actually shape .
and the reality that expression is coming all of us and moves , inspired and connecting us .
what nathaniel came up , so he brought back to the music in a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought back to a family of musicians that his mind was recognized his talent and it <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to repeat back to nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i got a musician .
thank you .
oh , bruno : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen <unk> .
i hope you &apos;re forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
that first , that was a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , a <unk> <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was <unk> in <unk> to the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel comfortable with him .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the head of the head of the company , and asked if i could be a event to be a event , about sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable really has become our chefs , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve got the oceans in the last 50 years , we have bare bare bare .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , who we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , i think , is a bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many of arguments , but <unk> pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re taking tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of <unk> , so you &apos;ll get a pounds of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so , finally , a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to support her .
on the day of an event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
we call him a don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for them to grow so far out in the sea that their environment didn &apos;t fall . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is being <unk> from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added to it , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> is one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what feeds you ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins . &quot;
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that evening , i was in bed and thought , what is a sustainable protein ?
so , i called the next day , a minute ago , i called a minute .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to be .
well , i &apos;m going to <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a proper answer to me , until i finally , with the senior biologists .
we also call him a too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and to food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
we may be two percent .
&quot; now , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable is to feed the chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause to the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to <unk> myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have <unk> from this fish because i swear to god , who has been <unk> for this entertainment .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of story of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you &apos;re trying to learn your fish , you love the fish .
i had it first to be eaten in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish since a long time .
it &apos;s got us <unk> .
he came up with a bright , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
wait twice .
and he &apos;s still delicious .
who can &apos;t taste a fish so well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can &apos;t .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he &apos;s not just cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the top of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they were raised <unk> on what essentially the wetlands .
they made it by taking the country .
they built this complicated string of channels and they were <unk> water out of the land and beyond the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make it , that worked , not economically economically .
and the green is a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of birds around what &apos;s a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company , it &apos;s been bought with green .
what did you do ?
they &apos;re the flow of the water around the flow .
they literally have the levers .
instead of using water , they used the water , they used water to <unk> the water back again .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a million hectares of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and the <unk> of the ecological destruction completely around .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something else .
they &apos;re looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see , these are <unk> channels and this density , green <unk> .
i was not a long time with <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of a car croc . &quot;
okay ? so we were responding to the wetlands and i fought and <unk> , and i <unk> <unk> to my knees and <unk> <unk> .
here he lifts a rare <unk> box .
now , he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bundle that reminded of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that the largest part of his career in the <unk> national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national
i asked him how to become a <unk> company .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and over the more talk about rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had to <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how do it be so delicious ? &quot;
he showed up on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that is incredible .
but what food is your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
now , he goes to me to tell me that it &apos;s so a rich system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the flexible biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there is no food .
you &apos;ve seen from a farm of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later , i went around this site with <unk> , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be so , &quot; for a farm that i ever had ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
and at the moment , it was like a film film would have to be a <unk> .
and we <unk> around the corner and we gave us the most incredible vision , thousands and thousands of pinker , a white carpet so far as well as well .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> in the birds .
well last year , on this site 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest one today , and one of the most important private health care in europe has become in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> , not the last one that you want to have a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we build <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat is the phytoplankton .
so the other pinker is the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink the <unk> . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success at health .
one <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> of the first never have been there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
they do this because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
so i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at the <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly 240 miles to the farm and fly it 240 miles back to the evening ?
do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , as i was quoted a song from whitney to haifa .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because they &apos;re better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish , and i mentioned the <unk> , and i don &apos;t like a <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i don &apos;t cook for that .
and yet , when i tried them in a restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t even tasted any <unk> .
she liked sweet and it in it as if you take a bite .
i mentioned the to <unk> and he &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last defense camp before something in the body .
it has evolved in the course of evolution , to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he put on it , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that measures their success at success .
and then i realized , when he says a farm that has no <unk> , it &apos;s enormous , because the water that comes from from the river <unk> in .
it &apos;s a river that takes all the things that are the rivers that are now , they tend to lead to connect chemical pollutants , the <unk> of <unk> .
and if it fought by the system , and this leaves is water clean , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that measures their success at health , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water <unk> water , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should also do , because these love love , like romantic , is also <unk> .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good foods whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in food , in the food , actually taste well .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> ; we &apos;re lover . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about local food ; we &apos;re eating organic .
and if you say that the things that are the future , the future is somebody &apos;s going to tell your future , someone else &apos;s coming somewhere , and says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how will you feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , because we &apos;re already already making enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our energy over the last 50 years .
feed crops , <unk> at <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken in fish , and all the time the agribusiness were simply asking , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can be that ? &quot;
that was the reasons . it was the easy thing . it was the business of american agriculture .
we should call them , what she is , a industry in <unk> , a pharmaceutical industry , the fast <unk> capital of <unk> , which is that the way that we can do .
this is not a marketplace , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatens today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of the resources of resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile land , not by <unk> , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but by <unk> , but by <unk> , but by <unk> and nets , but by fish .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable any community to enable themselves to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
so , the capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it never has never really done a good for food .
so let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what it is , in two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
and the monkeys that are not worlds for themselves , the monkeys that instead of dealing with the <unk> , which is the <unk> , instead of only <unk> , farmers who are not only but <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones that are also experts for taste .
and if i really am honest , they &apos;re a better cook than i ever .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
now , if i want to do this , you know , it &apos;s the number of data that we consume , we &apos;re bigger than the sum of your parts and rather than to think about how we see the trends that otherwise otherwise would be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can be able to filter a certain cause of death , say , we &apos;re going to be accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> , the people are the most active , and they &apos;re over here .
we can move further out and line the data and see that the data and the average of usual suspects are , but not for everybody .
now , if we go on and age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , that accidents are the cause of the cause to worry about people .
and who &apos;s been true in men , that &apos;s true in men .
so you realize that this is a look at information and data in this way , in a living <unk> .
and if we can do this for data , why don &apos;t even do it ?
so what we &apos;re here here is the <unk> of every single <unk> <unk> , &quot; which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually be testing it to my talk to your <unk> .
you can have a <unk> in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
so , if i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this issue and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i go here , i click here , i &apos;ve been mentioned to all the <unk> armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all of the subject of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going back to step back and <unk> the way .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you plot in this kind of information , <unk> , wider , <unk> , <unk> , then you don &apos;t just don &apos;t just do not just do not just not just do .
you make something that &apos;s a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between between , and we think it changes the way information being used .
so i want to take this idea now a little bit more than what a little bit crazy .
what we did here is , we took every single <unk> and it &apos;s reduced to a little summary .
the summary , the short <unk> , and a symbol of the area that you get .
i just show the top 500 of the rings <unk> .
but even in that <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the topics that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
well , after i &apos; &apos; government , i know that the <unk> that are most of the time of time <unk> &quot; human years . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
so that &apos;s just to see if you go back and look at all the way .
... i can then be a certain of these summaries , i can go back to the subject of time , &quot; human beings in the year , and everyone together .
so if i look at all those people , i think that the majority of them are <unk> . some of them come from science . some of them , come from the economy . some of the economy , and here &apos;s my boss , and a comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , a bono , a ted prize prize .
so we can jump and look at all of the ted prize prize .
you see , we &apos;re seeing the web of times as if it &apos;s really a network , not just by the side , it &apos;s much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else could show you what a little bit of surprise .
i just show you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at web sites that -- and we bring these <unk> to each single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and jump directly into a specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you &apos;re just looking at the view of websites in this way , and look at all the way of the whole way of seeing .
so i can zoom in my course , in a certain frame frame .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve thought to this way .
and i can sort of like anything i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
and , if i &apos;m going to take a step around and i can see all the course , i can rearrange my course , maybe i went to &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; em , &quot; here , &quot; for a live labs , or here go to live labs .
and i can go into the site and call them back again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to be used again , and every time it makes the bigger bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk from the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this out and the internet on the way , so that we &apos;re going to go from one to the other , so that we can go from many things to many things , and you can see patterns that would be hidden in their lives ?
if we can do this , then this is , this past , maybe a new source of information information .
and , instead of just moving up to information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , we can actually see <unk> from it .
i hear it , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> &apos;s <unk> fiction .
in my school school , i went to school , i went to school every day an hour per hour .
and my nose always put in a book , a <unk> , which was <unk> my thoughts in other worlds and in <unk> , my deep in me , insatiable curiosity .
and this curiosity showed me that , if i didn &apos;t always be in school , through the forests , and went and <unk> frogs and snakes and <unk> , and <unk> , everything would be in home and watched the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it &apos;s always been trying to understand the world and understand the limits of the possible .
and my love science fiction appeared in my environment , because at the late &apos; 60s , we were flying to the moon and the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder that we could never have before before .
and then , it &apos;s very good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was artist .
i could draw . i could draw painting .
and because there &apos;s no video games , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the whole painting of the media landscape in my head had to create the images in my head .
so , we had to read all of us , when we read a book , if we read the description of the book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected it on our heads .
my reaction was drawing and draw from aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all of that .
in the <unk> , i was caught from the teacher , like i hid in the southwest textbook .
creativity must have to be out .
and what happened was interesting . what was i was <unk> by jacques <unk> was the thought of a completely unknown world here on our earth .
certainly , i would never get a <unk> world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually could actually happen to happen , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all of what i &apos;ve always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to be diver .
the only thing that was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
i don &apos;t let me charity .
i <unk> my father until finally , until finally , a <unk> in buffalo , new york , i had taken , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the most <unk> in the middle in the winter in the winter in the winter in the winter .
but the ocean , but , i got a real ocean , i only got two years later to face when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , the now , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water , and 500 hours of them in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the most <unk> oceans , so rich in <unk> life is how we really hardly imagine .
the architecture of nature doesn &apos;t know any limits , as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until i think , for today , i think the deepest reverence i &apos;m looking at my dives .
and my love is holding the ocean , as the same intensity as ever .
and then , when i was a profession as an adult , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner , to create stories with my need to create images .
as a kid , i drew books and so on .
so , the movies of the way to bring images and pieces together , that fit together .
of course , the stories i <unk> myself from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , i could bring my <unk> for the <unk> and diving with filmmaking .
so , the two are embedded in my two .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we &apos;re based on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
and what it came out was the first <unk> <unk> that ever see in a film .
the film doesn &apos;t have a money in which he &apos;s actually played his manufacturing movement , but i think this is something fascinating : the audience around the world was <unk> by <unk> from the .
according to arthur clarke &apos; law is <unk> <unk> technology and <unk> <unk> .
so they looked at something magic .
and that i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s not to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went into &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; i &apos;m going to go even much further .
together with <unk> , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and the success hanging on the way that that effect would be .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same one . but we have a little more money .
from those two experiences , a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company with my good friend stan <unk> who was the best <unk> and <unk> , she was called digital <unk> .
so the idea of this company was to jump the stage of analog processes with visual printers and to jump to the same with digital <unk> .
so we then did , and we did have a competitive competitive for a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually started to slow up with a <unk> .
i had this piece of avatar , which is written the measuring and <unk> effects in the whole new heights of <unk> , in the <unk> characters who had been made by <unk> , expressive characters who were made by <unk> , expressive characters who were made by <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar starts to be beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this , and i did this other film about the big ship that goes .
the <unk> , i have this as &quot; romeo and julia to sell it , and it became a <unk> <unk> order , a passionate movie .
so , in the <unk> , i wanted to actually wanted to the real train of the titanic .
so i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
i believe it , i convinced you , &quot; we &apos;re coming up to the train . we films the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
that &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i convinced you , to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that the own imagination can be a reality .
we actually created six months later , in a <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i see the real titanic from a <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really blew me out .
and the amount of things were enormous . we had to build cameras and the headlights and all kinds of things .
and i fell like this <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> comprehensive planning .
you go into this capsule , you &apos;re in this dark , <unk> environment , where don &apos;t have hope to save if you can &apos;t get back back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was actually obsessed with the deep sea .
but anyway , in the part of the things that i think and science has been doing it . it was adventure , it was . it was an imagination .
and it was a experience that hollywood could not be able to be able to be able to be able to .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
and in some of the following agriculture , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had seen before , and the science of the time we saw them , even had a word .
so that &apos;s really <unk> me , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met a little bit an extraordinary decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker &apos;s filmmaker in hollywood and i &apos;m going to be <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started to emerge , we were diving in the <unk> , and they were exploring it with <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our purpose was to see <unk> and the inner ship of the ship , which has never been done before .
no one had the internal <unk> of the <unk> , and you didn &apos;t have a tool for it . so we developed the technology .
so , i &apos;m sitting here , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is quite similar to the <unk> , and i know that the band has played there .
and i &apos;m going to fly through a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
i mean , i &apos;m just not just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever seen , because before i was a corner of a <unk> , i always knew what was going on the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was looking at months of the <unk> .
so the set was a detailed copy of the <unk> &apos;s blueprints .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me realize that you can use such <unk> <unk> , and so that you can use your own awareness in the vehicle in that other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound profound .
and maybe a little bit a way on what might happen in several decades , if you have <unk> to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
after this expeditions , we started what we &apos;ve seen down because of the bottom , actually , for example , this <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . this is sort of <unk> , but here on earth .
they live with the help of <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a at the sunlight , the system that we do .
and so you see animals that right next to a 500 degrees celsius that you can survive there .
at the same time , i was interested in <unk> , which was back in my childhood <unk> .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and the nasa and the <unk> , and they &apos;re driving for russia , and they &apos;re driving up to russia , and then we go to international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i took <unk> to the deep sea .
i took them with and <unk> to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who interested in such <unk> situations , and i took them to look at the sources of the <unk> and so they could test and testing instruments , and so on .
we did , in fact , i did , but actually , science , i did , in fact , <unk> .
so the circle of my existence as a <unk> , time , as a child , and the reality of reality .
in the course of this voyage of discovery i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot of science about science , but i &apos;m sure you can also have to be a director of a man , a leader of being a <unk> or so .
i don &apos;t mind the much of leadership before i <unk> these <unk> .
because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> movies , they don &apos;t make a money .
we &apos;re going to play a manufacturing movement , and we don &apos;t trace .
all of all thinking , i &apos;m like &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and would have <unk> the nails on a towel on a beach .
i &apos;ve all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no glory , no excuse , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it to the challenge , to the challenge -- and the ocean is the most <unk> environment that exists . you &apos;re doing it for the kind of weird connection that arises , when a small group of people are forming a team .
because we &apos;ve only done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working on for years , sometimes we were two to three months in the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the conscious thing that you have before each other because you &apos;ve got a task that you can &apos;t explain any other other other things .
when you go back to shore , and he says , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole way around the way , and the difficulties that have been through in common and knowing that they never can explain somebody .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so , as i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , trying to make the same thing to do , namely that you have his team and join in return to respect .
so that &apos;s really changed the dynamic .
so , i was back with a small team in <unk> terrain , we were <unk> , and we were in a new technology that we hadn &apos;t before .
incredibly exciting .
an incredible challenge .
and we were a <unk> for a year period of a year .
so , in this way , my way to make films completely .
there were people who thought we were doing , we were actually transported to <unk> and <unk> on the planet box .
for me , it was more a more sophisticated way to do my job , the real process that changed the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all of the end ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think , first , the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the conscious of your team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
i get young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice as i can do . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> you yourself .
they have different for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , you don &apos;t bet yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; failure is not alternative . &quot;
but in art and the study , we have to be an alternative because there &apos;s no <unk> .
no important of economic endeavor , the innovation demanded , the without risk .
you have to be ready to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to do with you to the way . we &apos;re not an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising to me because my <unk> at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed , to make the things we invent and deliver the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , actually actually even more important than anyone else on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years ; it &apos;s too much more rain . things are going to change as it can &apos;t withstand fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to gender .
so , it will be terrible for you .
and also , the <unk> is really important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of the price , to reduce energy , it would be the effective at the effective .
now , the <unk> is like the time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> was the industrial revolution in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> and so we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can build modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s put it in half -- let &apos;s meet a new barrier , and this barrier is attached to co2 .
co2 warms up the planet and the equation of co2 is actually quite clear .
it <unk> the carbon dioxide &apos;s co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative effects -- effects in the weather and perhaps worse , the <unk> consequence that the natural ecosystems collapse that are capable of these rapid ecosystems .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the process of <unk> <unk> and where their other follow is there are some of the butler , but not very many .
and there are certain ambiguity about how bad these are going to follow . but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve got the most <unk> several times , &quot; have we really have to go down close to zero ?
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is to zero zero , the temperature will continue to go down .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 foot truck , which has to come under a three meter in a three meter , and then you put it underneath .
this is a little bit down to zero .
well , we &apos;re going to be a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons : people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of any on the planet .
and somehow we need to produce changes that &apos;s going to decrease that .
it &apos;s a constant .
so just different economic changes in all , and we need to go from <unk> increase in reducing and to a decrease to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to be zero to the and the amount of energy for every service and the co2 that will be a unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at each one factor , and we think about it , we think that &apos;s zero .
it &apos;s probably a very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
first , we have the population .
today , live billion people today .
and it goes back to nine billion <unk> that are going to go on nine billion .
if we could succeed with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we may probably reduce this for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time we see a slope of it to see 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this is all the food that we eat , clothing , etc .
they &apos;re very good things and <unk> , and they &apos;re going to have to make these services for almost any on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes .
in the rich world , in the upper world , we could probably make more <unk> and less use , but average , that number will increase , and so much more than doubles , the number of the services that will be given together .
so here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s a time to read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , for efficiency , the e , the energy is , there &apos;s good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going to be .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other <unk> , through new methods , there are many services , which are many services that are in the amount of individual services , and they &apos;re going to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , as the manufacturing is <unk> , 65 p.m. : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; iraq : <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , the window is a lot of money for improvement .
so , in the overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a factor of three or maybe even about a factor .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now now 26 billion now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion now , maybe 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be a unit of energy <unk> .
it turns out whether you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn gas , no .
almost every single <unk> for electricity today , except the renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do on a global level , is a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonder .
usually there is no deadline that you need a miracle to have a miracle to a particular date .
usually you just have just wrong and some of them come .
in this case , we have to give up and a miracle in very short time .
well , i wondered how can i really get the really out ?
is there a natural <unk> , an demonstration that the idea of people here ?
i remember last year when i was getting mosquitoes and somehow liked the people .
the idea was really tangible for you really tangible , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell this .
i decided that the trace of fireflies would be able to be able to be able to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
and you &apos;re told you that they don &apos;t bite . actually , you don &apos;t even get the glass of the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get much much .
we need solutions , either one or multiple ones that have some unimaginable scale and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are many directions in which people go to see , i really see , i really see that big need to be able to afford those big demands .
i have the tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
and they may be able to do a <unk> contribution , and if you &apos;re going to do better than i expect , it &apos;s great , but my excuse here is that we can &apos;t give them , because they &apos;re all the significant problems .
let &apos;s see first fossil fuels at the first of burning of coal or gas .
what you have to do is it may be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to catch all the co2 that comes from the <unk> , to catch under the <unk> , and then they hope that it remains .
there &apos;s some <unk> that &apos;s going to be 60 percent -- 80 percent of the level , but it will be very difficult to get to 100 percent of the co2 , and a reason that is the biggest challenge here is the <unk> .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee what literally many billion times more than any kind of waste you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough thing .
next thing : <unk> .
the has three big problems . the costs of all the countries are high , and the question for security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human condition that the fuel is not used for the weapon .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that &apos;s what should be done .
the last three of five , i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables of energy as they often .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they need a fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density , which is generating dramatically than the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , a thousand times more than a normal power plant .
and they also apply these sources of rock .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem any day , it doesn &apos;t seem to do it every day , and the breeze is all the time .
so , you have to be , if you depend on these sources , you can have a way that energy can also be available in times if they &apos;re available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . so if we say , for example , that the energy source of the country is not only need to do , you need to deal with the risk that the energy from from the way .
and there is the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all kinds of batteries that are made , look at the car , computers , cell phones , computer , <unk> , for everything , and i found that all the batteries we now could produce less than 10 minutes of the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these <unk> sources over to say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest .
if you want to have to rely on 100 percent to be , you need an incredible <unk> .
now where shall we go , what is the right approach ?
a digital project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on it .
in each of these five sectors , we need at least 100 people .
so many people will say , they &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in ted group there are many , who already have been engaged in there .
bill big has multiple companies , including a different one called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold , and i &apos;ve funded a company that may be surprisingly , the nuclear approach is .
there are some innovation in the <unk> ; <unk> , fluidity .
the development has stopped in this industry , several time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some of the good concepts lying around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent of burning , the <unk> .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but actually , you had thought about it for a long time , but you couldn &apos;t simulate any sensible thing since then there &apos;s modern supercomputer since then you can see it , and you can see that , yes , it looks like that .
and because you burn that 99 percent burn , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you &apos;re burning the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s <unk> as a <unk> .
instead of going to break down , burning it , just burn it .
so , the uranium is <unk> <unk> , a bit like a candle .
you see that there is a kind of column , often as &quot; <unk> wave of reactor . &quot;
that really does the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the 99 percent . you have been cremated today , so , it &apos;s called uranium uranium .
the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many people talk about one 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really really really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will become produced in poor countries , and still , in fact , agriculture , and hopefully , is <unk> and cement .
so , to get these 80 percent to achieve the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note says whether we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a key feature of this .
if we go back to go back , how should the genome look like by the genome ?
it should have the two elements of these elements .
we should use the <unk> to get to reduce reduction in the way . the less we <unk> , the lower we will be the <unk> and so the temperature .
but actually , this note for things that we do is not entirely to have a completely <unk> to the big <unk> , just right , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs have to be tracking with <unk> , and we can measure : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> energy , the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this is actually , because we need to do for support of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very special wish that we invent this technology .
if you &apos;re only going to take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose this wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long and the way in the way in the way , and in the way , in the way , in the way , and china , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich and rich and all lives of those two billion are going to be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
so what do i do ?
we need to use for more research research .
when countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should take those <unk> and they would be shocked by the very low money that will be spent for these innovative approaches for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the news .
we have to lead dialogue and and more and more and things that are being done by government .
it &apos;s a really important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first of all , you can give us a idea of order to give this in the order ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all of the great scientists we &apos;ve done , we only need a few 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s viable works , you &apos;re only in the <unk> million .
the tricky step is to find the first <unk> of the first <unk> , to find another billion , the <unk> and the place in the beginning of the first of them .
once the first time it is , if he &apos;s like , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic economy is so different than the energy that &apos;s as well as we know .
to understand that , and that means to build the way deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column of a <unk> column , that uses <unk> and then starts to work down to down ?
<unk> : right . now , you &apos;ve always have to rethink the reactor , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of controls that , and that thing where you can go and <unk> things , and that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can think it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you think of a column -- they &apos;re buried , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burn 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> who gives itself a solution to the waste .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens to the waste : you can sit in -- there &apos;s much less rubbish with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists in this <unk> or <unk> in the reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so , what these reactors was a problem , which is what we fill in our fill and so reduce the energy rate .
but as you &apos;ve been talking about these people around the world , and you &apos;ve talked about this possibilities .
where is the greatest interest , what really does it happen ?
<unk> : now we &apos;ve not determined a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things to do is that we &apos;ve been doing a nuclear <unk> for all the <unk> , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china , i was talking about how this is <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a variant of a thing that was made .
that &apos;s a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , so everybody &apos;s a rapid reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your mind , can and probability and probability of the really really like this ?
<unk> : now we need one of those <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to reinvent and then 20 years to go .
this is basically the deadline that has to show us the <unk> that we need to .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is fine , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy to think .
and fortunately , it &apos;s dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , and we need hundreds of them , as their work work , the funds , the need to work for their pilots to work for that pilots to be able to do it .
and it would be best if there are multiple , because then you could use a blend .
in any case we need a solution .
the big possible breakthroughs , is this greatest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would be without the <unk> , but it &apos;s so much more important .
in the current sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how well as these work , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there is a molten fluid , which seems something difficult , but maybe that &apos;s what we &apos;re saying .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty is that a million times as much energy as a , we say , a <unk> and so , if you can deal with the world and other things , almost in the city of their league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to start to try and try to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you have too much , and you just have a heart attack . what &apos;s going on ? you might need a <unk> or something like that .
there is a <unk> called <unk> that &apos;s called the <unk> of various techniques to delay warming , so we 20 , 30 years longer to get their <unk> .
that &apos;s just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t even work at insurance because one that may be lazy to eat so because you know that you will save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you can think of the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a conversation in <unk> that it should be faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : have you two sentences to you might be able to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics is very different camps .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there is negative effects that are going to do with the clouds that are going to move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , which is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is like to aids .
you get the mistake now , and you pay a lot of it .
and so the notion is , if you have all kinds of problems problems in something that you just got to invest in something that &apos;s going to look at the way , and there &apos;s no people in the rich world that are looking at the ipcc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about .
but my dream here is that if you can do economic , and then the co2 is the same time , then the skeptics is , then , i wish it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you use all of those time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals of the people who are <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the better things we can do .
<unk> : well , the real thing for research -- say , the u.s. should be spending 10 billion per year than you today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it doesn &apos;t suffer from the other things .
you then go to big <unk> , and there can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund it , and it &apos;s going to fund the most of the waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> and funded just the learning learning , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much less less .
if the <unk> you get , a very high <unk> , then you can just keep up to the rich .
i mean , everybody else could have five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks about .
his new <unk> is now : why is the research isn &apos;t the research more ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories associated with the <unk> , but he understood that the one was very lonely group , and so he &apos;s going to bring the <unk> .
and this is a theorist of theorist i think for appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little that is supporting .
so bill , i think i &apos;m talking about most of all people here , if i say , i really hope you will be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> suggested a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . <unk> needs to <unk> the greatest largest <unk> structure with 20 feet , about a three tape , about a cotton thread and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
and , even though it really seems really hard , it really really hard hard because it &apos;s really hard to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops in the world , with students , engineers and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and there is something about this task , which is deep impressions in nature of working with the things that i want to share with you some of them .
usually most people start to orient themselves to the task .
you talk about it , what it is going to look like , they &apos;re going to make it look like it .
they then invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they <unk> and lay spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> &apos;s continuously time .
and finally , soon before you don &apos;t have time , someone would take the marshmallow and you &apos;re staring at the top , step back and go back and go back and &quot; <unk> . &quot; they admire her work .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s the &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is , that the whole thing is <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and under the worst , fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re irritated and they really make <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are also teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , and under the best , are fresh new york .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they &apos;re not only the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering : how does this ? why ? what ? what about that ?
and he tells us , &quot; neither of the kids spend a time at boss to be <unk> at the &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
there is another reason .
and that is that <unk> , they were trained to find a proper plan , ok .
and then they realize it .
what happens if you put the marshmallow on top of the top , they don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s <unk> is that they start with the marshmallow and making prototypes , we &apos;ve been with the marshmallow at the top so that they have been able to fix the way to fix the way .
<unk> is the kind of collaboration as the heart of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every trial , the children get immediate feedback and what &apos;s not .
so the performance is that we work with prototypes , so much , but we can see how different teams are acting .
the average of most of the most is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers do more , but not much , more <unk> than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
three is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they are triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build dynamic structures .
ceos are something about average , but here &apos;s it &apos;s interesting .
you &apos;re an <unk> administrator on the team , they will better better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see around and see &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they conduct the process , you understand it .
and that team , the water and the work will find significantly the performance of the team .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination are lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical of them , they get about six , the very stable structures .
i tried something very exciting .
i thought we &apos;ll bring the <unk> .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize to software for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this was happening . not a team had a stable structure .
if somebody had built a <unk> of a <unk> construction , he would have worn the price home .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting to be a strong effect on a strong effect ?
we went through this practice with the same students .
so what do you think ?
now , they understand the benefit of the machine .
so , it became a bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction at the time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually make a <unk> of a <unk> ?
the reason is , i can help digital tools and processes to help teams , to help cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> is doing , they will find out of the assumptions of them .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language or <unk> , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there is a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples of the world , how people do the system and <unk> .
there is also <unk> .
and the most hopeful thing i think is actually a <unk> sport is actually .
it requires that we all have our senses on the task , and we think we think we &apos;re very optimal , how our emotions and our do , in the challenge that we &apos;re in .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all it takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so we would do as we would have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , a cool machine , and it &apos;s a machine machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t be in here and now .
and i ask myself what they would choose because i have a question for my friends in time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s been seeking the idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you somehow become a little bit drawn to the <unk> .
and that &apos;s me .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i am an explorers .
it &apos;s because there &apos;s the ability to go back on this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was the greatest time that there was the one on the planet , no matter how are you &apos;re doing : health , wealth , wealth , and <unk> , declining <unk> .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> died of all of them died as they were 60 .
my grandparents were <unk> this number of <unk>
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so , there was better at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a child who is born in new new new new new new new new new , is to be a long way of life like the richest man in the world .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox , smallpox , smallpox , have killed billions of people on this planet .
they have grown the demographics in a way to new form , like it has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world there exist diseases that have been threatened by a generation of us , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try things to try and see if it works , it &apos;s changing if it doesn &apos;t do , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements in a billion people in the world every day hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and it &apos;s a shame .
and not just that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , water , gas : they &apos;re going to be , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t disappear from this chaos .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , which is going to be feeding billions of people , without the country they live in .
i think we can power this world with energy that they &apos;re not used to the same at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but that keeps me awake -- one of the things that i have never been to awake . we &apos;ve never need science as well as now , not yet , not yet , not yet , not yet , not yet , not .
and we were also even able to be able to make it sensible <unk> , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the threshold of astonishing , astonishing events , and yet i really think that we have to go back to a lot of , 300 years before the enlightenment , and to be able to deal with a time where we have massive <unk> , and more fronts than now .
people are looking at their faith , and that &apos;s so close that you can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth will get off .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion , even a rather , to the point .
but you know , what they don &apos;t right ?
they don &apos;t quite quite a different of your own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to find out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about <unk> for &quot; the new yorker , a little article .
and i was astonished to hit resistance to the resistance toward what the most effective delivery in health care in the history of mankind is .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and drove on .
and soon i wrote a paper about genetically modified food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people played crazy .
so i wrote a paper about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they thought that molecules would be a certain rather than a <unk> in the field of nature .
but you know , i &apos;m doing what i do . i wrote the article i &apos;m going on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re in , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
but that paper was worried , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally i found it out .
and that &apos;s because those guys who were me nuts in all of all of all of those who were .
these were <unk> people , well-educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , we know what .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to the process of progress .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic of this , with little quote , that is why progress .
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s the reasons that are .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science lost , and it &apos;s no reason why it wasn &apos;t .
you just can call a few names and the people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> of 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they were going to be right .
ask questions , ask the evidence , please ask them .
don &apos;t take any one .
but now it &apos;s : if you get evidence , you have to think that evidence , and we &apos;re not good good .
and i can tell that , of course , we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i never seen them , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published a story , a terrible story that the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine in relation .
very frightening .
there were tons of trials were done to see if that was true .
there are tons of trials should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , in england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , no correlation .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we think about anecdotes , we think what we see is what we think we feel really feel really .
we don &apos;t think of a <unk> of a <unk> , which is data , and i understand that , i think that we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating .
so , devastating because of this fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> of measles is falling down .
that &apos;s <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what &apos;s happening is that we could do that .
well , i understand this . i understand .
because here &apos;s somebody &apos; customer ?
has one one in the audience ever to see someone who are dying ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
so in this country , not , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here is , we can fall in denial and and people like jenny can be walking around and illiteracy and illiteracy and illiteracy and illiteracy and illiteracy like the oprah and the fabled king live in preach .
and they can do it because they &apos;re not connecting the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equally as well , but almost the same thing .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
it <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of mankind .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just evolved with a few other people with a <unk> .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
now , this is good , except that paul walking around and talk about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people just should stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s actually he says that .
paul is a terrorist .
if paul &apos;s a public <unk> , he cannot tell without arms of <unk> .
he &apos;s got calls at home because people like to tell him that you know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul &apos;s a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need this , but vaccines are essential .
take them on , return to the disease , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have now measles in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon children will die back to die because that &apos;s just one question .
and they &apos;re not just going to be dying of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take it . why not ?
so a <unk> of me wrote a few weeks ago , and i said she &apos;s a little bit to <unk> .
no one has ever said that before .
she would not win your child against <unk> . no one .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> on this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe i &apos;m sure i &apos;d put somebody in lagos , in a plane , and flying in los angeles , right now he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> , and he &apos;s coming down long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of those <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because so the world works .
that &apos;s the planet that we live in . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to disregard ourselves in lying . we love this .
did you take all the vitamins in tomorrow .
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to make .
i know they &apos;ve done this because half of americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . more they never do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to be 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m totally voice .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think , i think -- we hate the medical industry .
we hate a tough government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s perfectly amazing to and <unk> itself that can afford to be able to afford .
so we &apos;re going to run away from , and where we &apos;re going to work ?
we &apos;re walking into the poor of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter because it &apos;s crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve all kinds of little <unk> .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , was <unk> , <unk> , because , i don &apos;t even know what that &apos;s , but we &apos;ll give billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s been cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , people screaming me and say , &quot; what does it care ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it &apos;s no matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt the evidence of my experts &apos; or any <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you &apos;re going to go on this path where they could have evidence and science , you get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 by 400,000 his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , much more effective than <unk> drugs , we know that they can be able to be able to the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths deaths in a country that will be worse than any other from this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have the consequences .
they have it . they always have them .
well , the <unk> epidemic we &apos;re in , is this kind of ridiculous battle between the <unk> genetically genetically <unk> foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
all we eat , every <unk> , every branch of <unk> , every branch of <unk> , has changed from people .
you know , there were no <unk> of paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did all of that .
we &apos;ve done it in the last month .
and some of it has done , and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more and , of course , there &apos;s risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , their lives .
don &apos;t you want to do it ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we rebel changes food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m talking about is too much of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have a huge fields with a thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies .
we don &apos;t want to have companies have seeds .
and you know , what my answer is to all this ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not a idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> millions of people from eavesdropping .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will grow 70 percent more than the second . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . shame .
they need it , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically modified food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like they were <unk> .
it &apos;s something that half a billion people .
it &apos;s about how a potato .
it &apos;s just a sack of calories . it &apos;s .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all of this .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all of what i can tell is : why do we deal with this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we deal with this ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes <unk> . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our motivations for larger food , better food , mutual food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to understand the highest time , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that if we &apos;re so much more than we do so far as we do , we think , i think , not , i think , you know , you look at all of colonialism .
there is no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly ; it &apos;s not worthy , and we really need to be able to do it .
so , after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; are you still going to get into this ridiculous machine and in the future ? &quot;
in every case . i want to be in any case .
in the moment , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put these machine machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> where we want to <unk> , and we will move them where we want to be .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time time and go into the future , we &apos;re happy to be happy to have done .
i know we can , and as far as it is something that &apos;s going to be in now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it may seem curious to be a magician , it &apos;s because they &apos;re looking at it as i think , as a delusion that is really true , if someone is just sure enough .
in other words , <unk> , in some studies have an measurable effect , the <unk> , and it &apos;s because the person thinks that the person thinks , because the person thinks what happens to you , is a measurable effect in the body that you call the <unk> .
a delusion is going to be a little bit because somebody is so like that .
so , we want to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been to be in every child &apos;s <unk> for children .
i even learned it from the <unk> <unk> magic of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and then you &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m going to explain him .
so , look , what happens .
the knife you can study it ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife so much as i was .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing goes away in my sleeve , or from it comes out , i just get my wrist right here .
in this way you can see that there &apos;s no time anything moves . so as i &apos;m here , it cannot go out to my sleeve , or get out .
and the goal is just quite simple .
i &apos;m open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will hold off through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so stuck in the place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or coming out , no <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often have little kids , who are really interested in the heart , because you can learn a lot about deception if you &apos;re looking at , although it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
probably many of you here in the room is this trick .
it &apos;s like this way .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to tell my wrist , to make sure that nothing goes off in my sleeve , or the way , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m doing my wrist is that there is the secret of the illusion .
so , at the moment , where i &apos;m my hand from you , so you can see them from the back of the back , this fingers , just , my <unk> , just where he was , in a position that he &apos;s so extended .
great trick ?
there is somebody in the back of somebody who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> myself , the fingers changes its position .
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t think there &apos;s only three fingers , because the mind and the way it processes , it &apos;s not individually count , one , two , three , but it looks as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not all the way , and then i open my hand .
of course it &apos;s not <unk> , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my favorite <unk> , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing is , by holding me , is going on through this movement , that the fingers will be <unk> .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick , you can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did that has to do with the <unk> ?
i read a year ago , or i read a study that really has been really blown me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or scientists , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
and it turns out , if you offer a dummy dummy dummy dummy pill , in the form of a <unk> , is just a round of round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you &apos;re the shape that you give you against against the <unk> , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue color and a character that it is , actually measurably more effective .
and that , although none of those <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but one white pill is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me freak me .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all about .
if you &apos;re embedded in capsules , the more effective than every form .
a colored capsule that &apos;s in yellow , and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the fibonacci dosage is a role .
one pill twice a day , not as well as three pills , i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is , ...
... that also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab your needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected into a patient .
that creates a very powerful image in your mind . that &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projector table .
so , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem so good as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t seem so good like a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem so well like the needle .
and none of it has any really <unk> trait , it &apos;s only our belief that has been carrying a stronger effect in the inside of us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magician .
i &apos;m going to take something that obviously is a pretense , and it &apos;s really look like it .
we know from the study that you have to reach to needle if it &apos;s supposed to go to the point .
this is a 18 inch long . it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to start a little bit sterile .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special story from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and through them , until you put it down to the other side .
if you &apos;re bad -- if you &apos;re slightly apart -- i showed that a couple of friends in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman &apos;s almost powerless .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be a little bit , you look for the next 30 seconds , and you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same , but you can also see it , but you want to do .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts to be part of my arm just to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do it crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side of the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had to <unk> .
about it .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right now ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> yourself the skin , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people say , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t really see it right . &quot;
the people in the <unk> are now .
let me show you from close .
that &apos;s really my skin . this is not a special story of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can &apos;t see the <unk> .
sorry . if you &apos;re tough , look , you &apos;re looking for you .
the people back , or the ones that you see , at some point , you &apos;ll see , &quot; well , this looks quite impressive , but if it &apos;s really , it would be really , it would cheat . &quot;
okay , let me just get a little blood for you .
yeah , there is it .
otherwise i would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there &apos;s not <unk> .
but i think , in this frame here and with the intention of a illusion of a real thing , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in it and go from the stage .
we will meet a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking for it . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve been able to have some people who have been published by the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there is a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there is a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of those flood of work , there are multiple cognitive ones that somehow somehow make it quite impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly going to act of these cognitive fall .
that &apos;s true for <unk> , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s been true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we &apos;re just so confused as everybody else .
the first one is a <unk> , complexity to admit .
it turns out that the word happiness simply is simply not useful , because we &apos;re using it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just do it , but in the big and all the things we need to give up , and we will be going to think the complicated perspective of what &apos;s well-being .
the second thing is <unk> of experience and memory : basically , you &apos;re going to be happy in his life and happy to be happy , or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the picture of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the miserable fact that we cannot think about a situation that we can &apos;t think about a situation of well-being , without its significance .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s simply no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a <unk> to one of my lectures , who said a story . &#91; unclear ... &#93; he said he had a symbol of music , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he did it , really , really emotional , that ruins the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had been the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
they counted out because he was a memory of <unk> ; it was memory , and that memory was all he had to keep on .
what we really says is that we could think about ourselves and think about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there is a <unk> self that lives in the presence and the present , the present is capable of seeing the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , the physician &apos;s <unk> -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; well , if i &apos;m you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is , and it &apos;s the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s the doctor , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s the doctor , &quot; how did you feel at lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how did your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self and the two of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really , really , really , with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re making stories about them .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to keep it in our experience .
and let &apos;s start with an example of a example .
there is an old study .
these are real patients that would have been a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into this , and it &apos;s not more painful , but it was painful , as this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . this is their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who who has suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has a clear ending . his <unk> has been longer , and every minute of pain , the patient has a had to have a patient b and more .
but now , there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients that they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much worse <unk> at the <unk> had to b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and none of this stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is clearly even worse than the other .
and the worse thing is the , where the pain was at the end of the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
where do we know ?
because we asked those people who were asking their own list , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
from the <unk> of the <unk> itself , b has a worse time .
now , what you could do with a a bit , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually turn the <unk> from the bed in it without a very much of him .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient &apos;s disease , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you have to make it &apos;s a bad thing , and you have it &apos;s made that the <unk> itself is a much better than a much better , because now you have a better story about your experience .
what is a story of a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that makes us memory and it also also to the stories that we invent .
so , a story of a story is <unk> , meaningful moments and ends .
they &apos;re very , very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
now , the <unk> itself lives live continuously .
it has multiple of the <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
i mean most moments of our lives -- and i think -- you know , the psychological presence of the way , as about three seconds , which means you &apos;re about 600 million of them , and most of you don &apos;t leave .
most of them will completely ignored from the <unk> itself .
and yet , you kind of get the impression that you should count , that what happens in this lifetime of life is happening in our lives .
it &apos;s finite resource that we &apos;re using as we &apos;re in the world .
and as we use them to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
from the <unk> of the <unk> itself , if you have a holiday and the second week is exactly as well as the first , then the <unk> vacation is twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s not how it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> tag barely been on on the <unk> vacation because there &apos;s no new memories .
they didn &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is a <unk> itself from a <unk> self , and time has very much affecting this story .
now , the <unk> self is more than to remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually one of the things that make decisions because if you have a patient who , we would say two <unk> at two different surgeons and decides what to choose , then , the one who has memory is less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as well .
we think about our future for more <unk> memories .
and basically , you can see that , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , the way that the <unk> self is actually <unk> by experience that the <unk> itself .
i think that if we &apos;re doing a holiday that &apos;s a very often , that is , we &apos;re going to have on vacation , in the ecosystem of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much we we do that ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the domination of the commons .
and when i think about that , i think about a vacation that we &apos;ve been doing in antarctica , who was clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think about a lot of the relationship with the way i often think of other .
and i probably have been about my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve been the same card to the <unk> , i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s probably a half of hours .
there seems to be a prisoner of the prisoner .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i <unk> on the <unk> of memory , but even if you &apos;re doing more of the amount of weight in the <unk> of the weight that we &apos;re experienced ?
so i want you to think about a thought thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know that the end of the <unk> all of the <unk> all of the images are annihilated , and they &apos;re getting a <unk> drug , so you can &apos;t remember .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you choose one of the other holiday , there is a conflict between the two types of self and you need to think about how they &apos;re going to decide that , and that &apos;s really not really obvious at all , because if you think of the mind , you could think of a different answer .
why we choose the <unk> , we choose a problem that we can imagine with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self just throw two terms of happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one one self .
so , you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then they would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for times , a rather complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re just capable of getting a pretty good idea of happiness even over time .
if you ask the happiness of the smartest self , it &apos;s a different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy to live with a person .
it &apos;s like happy , and i &apos;m happy to think of how happy , if this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anybody who don &apos;t get to make these terms of different , the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being that i &apos;ve been so adapted to the research of happiness , which is the way that i kind of like .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and happiness itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two of the <unk> .
the gallup organization has a global survey where the more than half a million people who have been asking , what they think about their lives and over their experience , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of both species of themselves .
and the main lesson we think , i think , i think they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that &apos;s really , really doesn &apos;t tell you much about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation that &apos;s about <unk> .
what that means is that if you get somebody hit , and you would say , oh , your father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your greatness ?
now , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there is much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
and if i tell you that somebody is a scale of 10 , you have a much of a number of things that you &apos;re happy about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness of the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means is being happy with people who may like , time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re really able to maximize the happiness of the two types of self , they &apos;re going to do very different things .
so the conclusion of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t really think happiness about it as a <unk> for well-being .
it &apos;s completely different term .
well , very briefly , another reason we don &apos;t realize happiness is that we can &apos;t look at the same things if we think about life and in fact , in fact .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , are you not going to answer the right answer .
if you think that question , you think that people have to be happier , you &apos;re saying , in ohio lives .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the value itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self , which decides how happy people are .
but now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can end up -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are going to <unk> the way to the hope , happier .
now , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier because if you think about it , how terrible the weather was in ohio , and they will feel that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;m going to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
well , when we did a couple of weeks ago , she told me that there was a pretty interesting thing that was made out of this election poll .
is that something that you can do is , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we absolutely not to find absolutely .
we found that in terms of the happiness itself .
if we were looking at how feelings are vary with income .
and it turns out that there is over a income of 60,000 dollars in the year for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample of the income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly unhappy , ever , ever , they &apos;re poorer .
we get one perfectly flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so far as flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money is not a <unk> , but that lack of money is certainly miserable , and we can measure this very miserable , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve the happier .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in all american persuasion , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take seriously , i mean , it seems to be able to put it all on your head , everything we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is generally going to take a <unk> of the world &apos;s going to take care of the world ?
<unk> : you know , i believe that it is recognition for the role of the most important in politics .
the recognition will be slowly , to be a question , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening in other countries .
people are in the ways that they should think of happiness when they think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will argue whether they want to study <unk> , or whether you want to study immorality , so we have to have this conversation quite soon .
how to be lucky , you can raise very different depending on how they think and whether you think about the <unk> self , or whether you think about the <unk> themselves .
that &apos;s the politics that i think , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re looking at the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s going to think , in the next one , or two decades of the human statistic .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should at least the most interesting thing to be tracking for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years now , and i &apos;ve been doing it for 10 years , and i think it &apos;s just as easy to save the world in reality as they &apos;re in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including them , including them , including them , and they &apos;re playing more and more games .
we &apos;re now spending three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of games for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think how many problems we desperately have to solve in the real world .
in fact , my research on the institute of the future is , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most pervasive problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to live the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that time at 21 billion hours of hours a week .
and that seems to be a little bit more , so , i &apos;m going to be able to work , so , if we problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to be a look at at least 21 billion hours per week to the end of the next decade .
no , i really really seriously .
why ? this picture is quite exactly why i think that games are so essential for survival of human species in the future .
this is a tudor portrait of photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to catch the emotions in playing , so he &apos;s got a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may be able to give you some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also , very , very , very much , and really , really , really difficult in solving a really difficult problem .
and if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here , the next <unk> eyes and the mouth are a signs of optimism . the eyebrows may indicate surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know . ok . so , so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so much positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> victory .
this player is a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of <unk> around the world , if we have to take the the the the the the world &apos;s the next century , the face of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see that in real life , if we &apos;re difficult problems .
i call it as a &quot; in life i &apos;m bad in life , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , like i &apos;m bad in life i bad .
this is an graffiti in my former home in berkley , california , where i was in my dissertation in my dissertation , why we &apos;re better in games than in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that &apos;s a lot of players .
we think we &apos;re not as good as well as playing .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s going to be .
we can get more in more <unk> . i mean , my good job with the motivation , to do something more <unk> , inspired to work with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think many of us will be in our best version , anytime and immediately , <unk> the problem trying to solve the problem as long as we need to try and try it again .
and in reality , if we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel ourselves , we &apos;re feeling threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings we never have when we play games , they just don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a student .
why is it impossible to be able to think , you could not just do anything ?
how can we transmit these feelings in the reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which is the ideals of the environment in the collaborative problem problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that actually can be able to make advantage of these <unk> in the way .
so first , when you get into one of these <unk> , especially in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to be <unk> , and it immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fit perfect at your current level in the game , right ?
so , you can do that .
they never have a job that you can &apos;t solve it .
but always on the edge of your capabilities , so they have to work . but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and <unk> <unk> . there &apos;s always been very specific to do something .
and there are plenty of staff .
where you can also go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to work with their epic mission .
that &apos;s not as simple , that &apos;s not as simple , that feeling that there are a <unk> of many employees .
and also , this epic story is , this is inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re defined by &quot; a level high , &quot; and + a strength , &quot; or a <unk> . &quot;
that constant feedback , it &apos;s not true life .
so if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk : a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i &apos;m not getting in real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of the <unk> of the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the outskirts of a <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;d rather spend our entire time in this <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world world of <unk> were spent <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it might sound nasty .
but to see it in context , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go upright .
so the first upright primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play with play , just the way that you think about the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate . because it turns out that we use these whole time on playing , actually , change what we &apos;re in the situation .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , very much .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
and look at this interesting statistic , which was published by a researcher from carnegie university : the average boy man from today in a country with severe <unk> spends 10,000 hours to the 21 of life .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons .
first of the time , for kids in the united states , <unk> hours of the <unk> , they spend in school , from five grade to the school of the high school -- if you never have missing .
so we have a complete <unk> , which is to learn how to be a very good person as well as it means to be a good player , like anything else that you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> .
so , you &apos;re actually aware of the success of the success of the success of the $ 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> of the <unk> of any subject to the 21st of life , we &apos;re going to master .
we &apos;re going to do as well as the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is : &quot; what are the players are good ? &quot;
because if we could find out , we would never have the <unk> of human potential .
so many people have in the world , we &apos;re in the world that spend at least an hour per day .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which is extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> is developed <unk> , which save energy and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so that players are in the world , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil .
you expect a $ additional player in the next decade .
so we &apos;ve got 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is to master these games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of the first thing : <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do immediately to do with a set of a solution to believe that we have an educated hope to success .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth it to try and that &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are <unk> in the <unk> of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that show people more than we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve <unk> .
the reason for this is that there requires lots of trust , to play with someone playing a game .
we trust that there is a time to have a time with us that the rules of the rules that we have the same goal and to stay in the <unk> .
so the <unk> is allows the <unk> of <unk> , trust and each other .
as a result of that we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week is , sort of like <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier with them , so , when we &apos;re relax , or nothing .
we know that we &apos;re optimal as human beings work with the way we do hard , great work .
and players are always ready to work , and they &apos;re always going to work , if you get the right job .
and finally , <unk> is meaning .
players love it , <unk> <unk> missions .
here &apos;s a <unk> to back into the right side , and you &apos;re all of all of wikipedia , the biggest digital is the world .
the second second is the second digital digital is , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet and now in any other subject of any other digital world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so that &apos;s four superpowers to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only thing is that they believe , you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people are so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be a <unk> of a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i &apos;m making games , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
so he says that it makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
they can be connected social bonds than in real life , and they get more feedback and reward in games as real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely completely logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years ago .
there is these ancient cube , <unk> . you know ?
there was <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
and that was sort of evolved the first of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> of the old greek <unk> <unk> , you may be familiar with this story . the story of how to play games .
according to <unk> , games were <unk> , in the kingdom of famine .
if they were supposed to be such great famine that the king of <unk> himself was a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was a really extreme situation . it needed a huge solution .
so they invented , loud <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and <unk> with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived so much for the <unk> that famine , by having a day and the next one day .
so , i think , we &apos;re going to play games today .
we &apos;re playing a games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re making games to avoid the things that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially that &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re going to bring what we need from playing .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to the <unk> , after 18 years , the famine was not better . so , the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they divided the kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the victor to make a <unk> adventure .
they were <unk> and they were looking for a new home , and they were just going back to the way that it was food for survival and looking for the rest of the rest of them in which they can thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show show that the <unk> , which is the <unk> realm that later , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists recently have recently to realize that <unk> is actually true story in fact .
and geologists found evidence a global <unk> that took almost 20 years of what the famine .
so this crazy story might be true .
maybe they actually have their people through games by having 18 years , and then they had these <unk> and so much about the one that they were doing all of the civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;re playing for in 1994 of warcraft .
this was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> , which was 16 years ago .
they were played <unk> , we &apos;ve been doing warcraft for the 16 years since the age of 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to look for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be <unk> that half of us have an hour of playing a day with playing with the world of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask : &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly the question i &apos;ve been devoted to the the last few years at the institute for the future .
we have this flag in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people will allow people to make this idea into reality .
we can be able to make ourselves in <unk> and give people the possibilities to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about three games that i designed to try to try to get people in your own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that you have to get a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it &apos;s going to be realistic for realistic , and you &apos;re actually , and we ask them to blog about it , and we ask them to blog about it , video , photos .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied them since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an transformation .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an <unk> adventure and they said , &quot; we go from oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re talking .
find out how they were living , most of our players have the game <unk> behavior .
so we &apos;re going to be a bigger game for the next to higher , higher target than just <unk> .
we have the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute of the future .
and the point is a <unk> of the computation that the people only have 23 years on the planet left .
this supercomputer called global <unk> <unk> , of course .
the call to the players , it &apos;s a <unk> , we &apos;re designed almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played this game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google google .
and the last game we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re on on the third of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you end the game , she &apos;s got the <unk> award for social <unk> award , graduated from 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and the place they &apos;re going to learn a social change .
we have a comic deal with it . we have &quot; level high , to understand <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all , this game with young people around the world , all over the world , especially in <unk> , which is to benefit from their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that the players are human resources that we can apply to work in the real life and that games are a great importance for change .
we &apos;ve all rejected , <unk> productivity , the ability to connect strong social nets , <unk> and desire to <unk> importance .
i really hope that we play great games to survive on this planet to survive another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play games like this .
when i &apos;m going to go into a next decade , i &apos;m sure in two things : that we can create any future , and we can see all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start playing the <unk> .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a few months ago at writing a article for an <unk> accent .
i always have to write my <unk> on the day , but i was with the work of texts , and i realized that i never have been in my life in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot;
i &apos;m reading the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , despair , useless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and weak .
<unk> : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i read this list a friend of mine to say , and i had to laugh , it didn &apos;t have a ridiculous , but i was just going to go back to the <unk> and then , to see me , and then , after this <unk> <unk> shock .
of course , this was an old <unk> <unk> , and i just thought that the issue has been quite a bit .
but actually , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i started to build the primary school and began to build my self in the family environment , and also , in terms of other kids and the rest around me .
and god is , i don &apos;t use a <unk> .
would i be a little seriously taking a world that someone would be like a person in any of any positive , that can be positive , but i &apos;m going to be adventure for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve been interested in .
so i immediately immediately <unk> the <unk> of 2009 , and i expect that i find a <unk> piece .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words , i &apos;m going to shake the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language influenced our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many more <unk> societies , including the greeks and the romans , really believed that the pronunciation of a <unk> has a great force because that &apos;s what you can also be <unk> .
so , what do we want to actually <unk> -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
so , in fact , people &apos;s <unk> as a child , it could be good , you &apos;re chasing and you ideas about them .
would it be more beautiful to open up to you ?
a man who opened up to me was my pediatrician at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name , how you think , most americans couldn &apos;t hear correctly , so he &apos;s always called dr. p. .
and dr. <unk> was always <unk> very colorful , and it was just like created for the work with children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i had to be able to do a lot of times infinitely , infinitely with this thick , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated them , i hated her .
and imagine , i even have a <unk> kid with dr. p. and so trying to stop these practice , <unk> without success .
and one day he was at one of my practice -- these practices were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re like a powerful , powerful and young girl , you will tear one day of those ribbons .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the training that i don &apos;t want to do with the future , that , in fact , in fact , i &apos;d actually have to see my daily <unk> with new eyes . so that was a new and <unk> experience .
and i &apos;m asking today , how much of my vision of me as powerful and incredibly young girls , and i could imagine as a nature of <unk> , powerful and <unk> human .
this is just an example of many , how adults can stimulate the imagination of a child .
but as the already <unk> examples of the <unk> evidence , our language doesn &apos;t have a room to imagine something that we would all wish : it would be able to give you any single way to see themselves as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes , which is caused by a technological change in many cases .
so , from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium and artificial <unk> for aging , which allow people to actually do in the world and multiply and multiply around the world around the world .
so maybe this technology is really clear about that technological , because the one that there was a different truth , namely , that every human being able to do a whole lot of <unk> and very powerful and the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story because people always wondered about how i &apos;m with <unk> <unk> and i &apos;m going to think that i &apos;m very uncomfortable with people who are asking people to answer and i think , and i think , i think , and i think , i think , i think , and i think , i think , i
this sentence from learning from learning to <unk> , that success or happiness is dependent on , a challenge to master , and not the challenge that could be defined by the way of a prosthetic , or how many people can see me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing , of course , we &apos;re really aware of the challenge , whether it physically , emotionally , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
<unk> is not an obstacle that we need to be able to get to get better with our lives .
<unk> is just to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as a bit of my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very sane , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but he &apos;s all the time .
and i want to do not to have the impact of the <unk> of a human <unk> .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real and every person is going to be different , but the question isn &apos;t whether we don &apos;t get to be clear , but how we &apos;re going to get out .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for people who we love to preserve <unk> , but they &apos;re working for sure that &apos;s very clear to work .
and we don &apos;t really like to do our kids if we give them feel that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate things clear : to the medical &apos;s fact , you know , and for other social opinion about whether i am disabled , or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability that i had to have to have to get apart the world that they could describe me with these definitions .
in our wish , people who are to protect us on the heart and the cold , hard truth to the other person &apos;s disease , or even a forecast quality of life that you expect , we need to be in the way that someone is actually disabled .
maybe this is the right concept , which is just what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it for every single larger disability than the pathology in the way .
if we don &apos;t treat a lot of people , and not all of its forces and possibilities and appreciate , we &apos;re also able to fight the natural struggle that you might have to lead to have another disease .
we <unk> a human to our society for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and all the field of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s the perception of our flaws and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not deny these <unk> times , or deny the <unk> , we should not try to avoid them , we should not be under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see the <unk> opportunity .
i may think about that clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to do not necessarily not have to overcome , but that we &apos;re open to a <unk> , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can do it , <unk> as a little natural , <unk> and useful , and feel like that their presence is not so much .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in a very true in human character .
i would like this word : not the same thing of his species , and not the most fundamental of its species , but the way that changes the best can adapt .
conflicts emerges creativity .
not just from the era of this is , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and <unk> , from the struggle of human spirit , is determined by the way .
so again , change , and the great capabilities of humans .
and we may not know what wood is <unk> , if we &apos;re actually going to review .
it may be the sense of <unk> , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> is a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to have .
i think the biggest damage we have to have to do ourselves , is to believe that we should be normal .
even honest -- who &apos;s normal ?
there is no normal .
there are the usual . the typical . but not the normal , and they would really know these arms , gray person really know if you really were ?
i think rather &apos;t .
it would be great if we can take this paradigm of normal versus another , or the strength , to actually even a little more dangerous to design , but so you &apos;re going to invite the forces from very much , and they invite them to bring their special and valuable skills in society .
<unk> have found that we have people to have people who always have to be useful and to be useful and to make a contribution .
there is evidence that already , over the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries with severe physical injuries , and that would be valuable for society to be valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t be broken as hunting and powerless ; they were treated as special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the middle of the red zone , and i stood there in a <unk> tomato tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if you don &apos;t aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i was bringing her mother out of her mother . &quot;
oh , so it &apos;s .
and of course , it &apos;s made it click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i just knew from my mother &apos;s mom , because i was , of course , quite a long time to come back to the birthday .
the doctor of <unk> technology was on holiday , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had been left and a few toes on this and some toes at the other side he was the <unk> , that was to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you &apos;re never going to go , and never as if other kids , you can never have a valued life since they just lie . &quot;
and i really found that he had collected around my entire childhood , whether i had to take a <unk> in the second class , whether i was going to <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> medical school and the balkans medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> x &apos;s potential for the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough , how does this be a factor of life of the life of human beings .
and dr. <unk> , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t tell something else , and even if you get kids themselves , then kids can achieve a lot . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed .
he understood that the medical diagnosis and how someone manage to deal with two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my thinking about the course of time when they were asked me to be my <unk> <unk> of meat and bones , i would have no second .
i really wanted to be normal at that time .
so if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve seen something with my legs , and not even despite that experience .
and maybe this change happened , because i &apos;ve been so many people who opened me open to the doors , instead of people who have been left me , or a final idea of <unk> .
see , it &apos;s really just one person who show you how they can use their powers , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow it to someone to activate your own body , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for someone in a single moment , you open , and then you &apos;re a very good teacher .
you bring them to open up to open doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that in one is the potential of <unk> .
again : what potential would we want to do now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , was an case study , in the &apos; 60s , were transformed into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are going to be broken by notes .
and the a student will be <unk> <unk> , and then the better teachers on .
they then have been students with a <unk> period of time , with a &quot; brilliant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for you , &quot; it &apos;s been told they were very smart , and after those three months she was written .
and of course it turns out to hear the heart that the <unk> said , they &apos;re just a long .
and so it was , after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except by the students who had thrown out to be thrown out .
the key thing in this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that be the <unk> and that are the students with the grade , and they &apos;re just like they &apos;d teach them and they treated them .
the only disability is a <unk> mind , the mind has been broken , has no hope anymore , and he finds no longer <unk> of us , our natural , <unk> <unk> and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we can create the human spirit , to hope to be able to find themselves and other people around being beautiful , and , and then we can actually get our forces really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by an persian poet named <unk> in the 14th century , and i was written by my friend jacques <unk> , and the poem is , &quot; he &apos;s always repeat , and he &apos;s always repeating , and he &apos;s always repeating : come , dance with me . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you right ?
suppose i said that by few changes of their genes , a better memory may have more and more accurate and faster .
or want to be <unk> , stronger , more power .
would you want to be more attractive and more more more more ?
how much longer , how much more good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are already more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see me .
a few . probably , as many of the creative people are here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to mind ?
a couple more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the majority i like to do , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is it all just a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> topic here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the point of a doctor &apos;s view .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a paper called nothing in biology , not a sense of the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not accepting the evidence that are a very good time , your <unk> at the time , you take your own personal <unk> , and maybe you can make any sense of this talk , make any sense of them .
but if you accept biological evolution , what is it is just about the past , or is it &apos;s about the future ?
is it <unk> for other <unk> or it &apos;s too ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing <unk> on the tops of the twigs , they have survived ; it &apos;s got a place and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , far , of course , is that what we &apos;re most interested in most interested .
we branch from a common ancestor of modern chimpanzees around six or eight million years ago .
in this time period , it may be 20 or 25 different varieties of hominids .
some of them came and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re pretty remote remote parts of the other parts of life , but actually , in the greatest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite equal .
so , we realize that we can use from that , and the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human energy protein that uses to treat the naked ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> from what &apos;s going out of the pancreas .
and , with bacteria , we &apos;re aware of that every of us in our gut are more bacteria than the cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe many times as many .
i mean , think , when antonio damasio asks your feelings , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s hot , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you will all of you that they &apos;re all of them , they could only wish to be able to be able to help themselves .
it &apos;s really a easier way to bacteria , with occasional <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> forced to push to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help nutrients from the <unk> of the nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will be in the future ?
are we in a form of an equilibrium balance in a form of a species ?
or are we probably going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s step back at the time of the big bang in 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and four billion years ago -- the first of human species , which is happening in the last year of years .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life is only about the earth is just a mere <unk> ; the animal kingdom , like a single one , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s what we were .
and this is also the <unk> of this speech , so i hope , and i &apos;m going to have it in a <unk> .
well , when i was a <unk> at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i love in love with the power of evolution , and i think , a very fundamental existence in <unk> organisms , is each of living in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information that will be on in the two <unk> .
but at the time , as a <unk> organisms , the things started to change things .
sexual reproduction is going to be in the picture .
and so , very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that the genome is , the rest will be <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of the death of the body is in the same moment to be able to restore the sexual reproduction in the same moment .
now i have to confess , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the moment , but it seemed to be more privileged to my increased .
i came to the emotions of george killer that read in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat of his <unk> <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is a wonderful &quot; , says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the conclusion of the way that i was in a goal of the way that the goal of evolution -- not necessarily notice , only in different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the passing genome at the next generation , <unk> and survive generation to generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re like , and i designed like <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit to go into the ocean .
i think we would all think of the mood , the woody allen to understand the expression when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to immortality to achieve my work .
i want to get to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily have to be the largest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution is the creatures that are the most best to adapt their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
and the bottom of the ocean is bacteria there , and they &apos;re in the <unk> , and they would have done the so-called little , if they were there , there would be a vacuum of their fish , yet they could have done it to make a <unk> environment .
so , what happens when we look back what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space , the people in the evolution , and particularly how we <unk> in the next stage , i would say there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to move ourselves .
we &apos;ve reached a way to balance .
and the reasons that it would be , that it &apos;s been us to do is that it &apos;s been a lot of genes that have otherwise been <unk> and from the population removed .
and secondly , we as a species , we have a species , we have done our environment so that we &apos;ve done it , and we &apos;re in the same way we &apos;re in the way of them .
and by the way , we hike and circulate , and we mix so much that they can &apos;t tell longer , that isolation is necessary for the evolution , to <unk> .
a second option is that it &apos;s a evolution of the traditional species , of course , is to be considered by the forces of nature .
and the argument here , here is that the wheels <unk> the wheels slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so the isolation is , if we &apos;re seeding as a species , we &apos;re seeding the world , it will be <unk> and the changes in the environment , which may be in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , fascinating and scary possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just simply be , but led , and decided to make us as a <unk> in the decisions that we &apos;re doing .
now , how did that happen ?
how could we be able to do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that the people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so think if it &apos;s not just possible to choose your child your child , but also to choose to choose the body of genetic adaptations that cure and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic change to remove or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or reduce the energy reduce the risk or weapons ?
would you not want to do that change in your genes ?
when we <unk> , these kinds of change are going to be able to be more .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
and then when it was finished , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can take a sequence of the three billion base of the human genome at a cost of about 50,000 , and in the room of about a week .
it won &apos;t take more long to be able to be the reality that it will be the $ 1,000 to human genome , and it will be available to everybody .
one week ago , the national academy of engineering was engineering for the <unk> prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , two scientists who developed the natural process of evolution to allow us to work faster and to <unk> proteins into a more efficient way -- which is called arnold evolution .
a few years ago , the <unk> researcher was awarded the <unk> <unk> for his research to the research he took a grown-up <unk> , a <unk> , and through manipulation of just four genes that turns into a pluripotent stem back -- a cell potentially potentially in your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that the human insulin is produced in bacteria , which is not only protection but even protection but also can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the immunity .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang epidemic of influenza that &apos;s been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a little bit of a good idea of it ?
this is all reality and in the future is going to be much more possible .
now imagine two different little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could make the sperm and <unk> or the newly <unk> of the <unk> to give their kids to a life , to remove the diabetes , the risk of cancer will reduce the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science can allow the change to prevent disease , too also allow us to adopt goodbye to adopt , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of an ken <unk> , especially if you can expand the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not the fast <unk> , they can allow them to do faster faster ?
why no longer life ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the <unk> that we want , we will be converted to be <unk> by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that may have 100,000 years in the rule , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even over the next hundred years .
these are decisions about their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to deal with .
do we use these decisions to create society that is better , the more successful is the more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different qualities that we want for some of us , and not for others ?
will we make a society of <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we need to make make these decisions ?
in good like evil , and sooner as you might think , these decisions are going to us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a little bit of , a portable robot that gives you to your <unk> capabilities , or another , the <unk> can help , and go up and go up and go to go up and go up and go to go up and go to go up and go up and go to go up and go to go up and go up and
we call <unk> this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re not something else than something that you in the morning and gives you extra strength and the speed of the speed and you can help you to help you , for example .
that &apos;s what the true is actually , is actually , &quot; <unk> of human and machine .
but not just that -- it &apos;s going together and connecting them with the universe and other things out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you now , what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , who carries about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the request that you should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would think we would think of this challenge and create a <unk> that help , to deal with this problem .
so let me imagine now -- or the human rights is <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds of <unk> terrain , many hours .
so flexible design allows you to have deep in the way , to crawl and highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re now , with our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> of this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s look at the user , we &apos;ve got to put the user , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who have been in the world &apos;s been in the city .
that &apos;s about a percent of population .
and that &apos;s what a conservative estimation .
we often talk about very much young people with <unk> , who are living in the height of their lives -- &apos; 20s , &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; man &apos;s the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , their number are <unk> .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or to see other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since the way i have to say , really successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the field of mobility .
now let me imagine now , that &apos;s amanda <unk> , who suffered a <unk> , who suffered a <unk> , who has been a <unk> to the outcome that they hadn &apos;t been able to run more than 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , we &apos;re going to wear our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in crutches , the signals <unk> on our <unk> , which is on her back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is based on their hips as well as their <unk> , which they move forward in this very <unk> , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> <unk> me .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement from my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor &apos;s a doctor and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
it &apos;s <unk> every hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to learn from the time , to learn again , to climb up , and even to the hands up with the hands .
but nothing was invented me again , to now .
thank you .
and as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and for amanda , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m an boss of a non-profit organization called the robin hood .
if i don &apos;t <unk> poverty , i <unk> , as a <unk> of a volunteer <unk> in a volunteer <unk> .
well , in our city , in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer of the <unk> , so i had to be right to be in there .
but it was still a race against the other volunteer to get the authorities and figure out what our jobs would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which is certainly one of the most important days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the <unk> and a foot under a ship outside in the <unk> rain , while her house fell in flames .
the other volunteers who was just got to me -- call it <unk> luther -- got to go to the <unk> of the first and was asked to save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was envy .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who could tell the rest of his life , who could tell people that he was going to save a <unk> house to save a living creature , only because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me to be me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go to the fire , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i &apos;d hoped to do , but i went up stairs , the stairs , the real &quot; <unk> over the time , which is the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re actually done in the bedroom to bring a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i &apos;d put my prey back down where i met my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our <unk> out out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> has a letter of the <unk> , in which they <unk> for the brave volunteer for the day of her house .
one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> : someone had actually brought her a few shoes .
both in the robin <unk> <unk> , as though , in my <unk> as a scientist , i &apos;m witnessed of generosity and <unk> at the big scale , but i also see the charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room and people who have been able to have a success success , or in your way there , i want to offer this memory : wait for you .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another other , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something , you &apos;ll give it now .
they &apos;re going to <unk> them in a <unk> , room , in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , a chance will offer us to save life to save lives , but every day gives us to change one .
so they go on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
oh , i &apos;m going to mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where women lead the <unk> to sex with sex &apos; &quot; and the game is determined by the day -- where &apos;s a serious deal .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the pacific forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our closest living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , which lived in about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees , as a result , fear <unk> <unk> , the <unk> will lead the <unk> of female female .
they really have come up with this because this leads to be very <unk> society in the lethal force has not been seen .
but unfortunately bonobos are the least known under the primates .
they live in the deep of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the observation is not very hard to do .
congo is a paradoxical -- a country &apos;s extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the frontier of a violent conversation that has been authorized for decades and almost as a lot of life in the world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are survival of the bonobos .
<unk> and <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , you can &apos;t have a stadium to put the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laughter that the trees are horrified .
who are these relative ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , even <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules like that and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that , that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos is made more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives .
now , play is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s really fundamental to the bond of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
play increased creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of the behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human human <unk> , dance and of rituals .
play is the <unk> of the <unk> that &apos;s us .
now , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique footage straight from the wild .
first of a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
that could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she puts him with eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more , it &apos;s not true .
yeah .
so , so , <unk> is common , both bonobos as well as humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is , and also , as the game , and promotes the same time , it &apos;s huge fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take many forms of them , some of a little bit quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover that again .
and i want to show you , this is a young female , and she plays with water .
i think exactly how they &apos;re playing with sometimes , and we &apos;re <unk> dependent on our inner and the outside .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us start and interact and interact with the unexpected of the ones that we form , are the real ground of creativity .
this is just a small <unk> on the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
but they also true a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to the rising challenges , by greater creativity and <unk> increased cooperation .
the secret is that the key to the key to this is .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to be successful in a world &apos;s world , we need to play .
but will we make the best of our energy ?
now , play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
and the bonobo and people alike , they don &apos;t live from teeth and they alone .
now if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , it may be a <unk> .
and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and together , as we &apos;re talking about creativity and the wonder of the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , at the same day , in exactly the same moment , every baby &apos;s a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every baby &apos;s a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you imagine the whole time , you don &apos;t listen to me .
now imagine that &apos;s just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the sperm is carrying an y <unk> that &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> chromosome .
and in the other case , the sperm is carrying a x chromosome that &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both of light .
we come back to these people later .
i &apos;ve been in most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two faces .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking at the story of the anatomy .
i was <unk> <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- so that &apos;s human body , animal human body -- so that &apos;s human body , with <unk> , with <unk> ; as they thought about the body .
the other hat i &apos;ve been carrying in my work is the veteran , as a <unk> -- or , as i &apos;m sometimes saying , as impatients , who are patients who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so i &apos;ve been working with people who are twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller as usual .
and i often worked with <unk> people whose gender <unk> is -- so people who have the average male or female <unk> .
and as we &apos;re common term , we can use the word of <unk> .
<unk> is coming in many different forms .
i just give you a couple examples of <unk> that &apos;s not equivalent to the <unk> of the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> leaves the <unk> , which we &apos;re all of all , you &apos;re going to <unk> .
and so , the testes are on testosterone on testosterone .
but because of that individual can be missing receptors to realize that makes testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so testosterone , but not reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body evolved more of the typical of the course of them .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as girls .
but it doesn &apos;t take puberty until they reach puberty and grow their breasts and develop , but not their period until someone else comes to it , that there &apos;s something else .
and they make some tests and find out that instead of <unk> and the uterus , in reality , they have a y .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person to actually be male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called the <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> points of <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think i think i think i think i think i &apos;m not really the real <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical women like i actually speak to <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the consequence is that someone like me actually , is that someone was exposed to the brain that was exposed to more <unk> than a woman who was born with <unk> and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> isn &apos;t just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed over the whole range of bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago , i got the call a 19 man who was born when was a boy , he had a friend , he was a friend , he lived with his girlfriend , he lived , and he had just found that he was <unk> and a uterus .
it had a extreme form of <unk> <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> were so much active that they created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> was <unk> , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw a boy like a boy -- nobody had something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was in the <unk> that the physicians found that it was inside the inside of the female .
okay , just a quick example of a variant of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , are developing a little bit called <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why it happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties of different varieties .
the reason , why kids have the kind of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> twins , whether it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often become the norm , not because it would be in their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often have done different types of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s certain anatomic characteristic of a certain identity .
so we have the concept that being a woman is to have female identity , is to be a black person , is to say , to be an african anatomy in terms of your story .
so we have this terribly compelling idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body , which is actually something very different , and it &apos;s <unk> us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , if children are born , who are born , who are two people in a body .
where i had seen most of a lot of excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> last year was <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender organization has been asked to question in the question .
so many journalists would call me to the question : &quot; what the test they will do , which tells us whether <unk> <unk> female female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to journalists that there &apos;s not that test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature is going to be a single line between male and female and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , we &apos;re able to do that line as of course .
so we have a situation where we &apos;ve ever been to the extent , the way our science progresses , we have to think about more likely to be able to create a stable , that these categories that we &apos;ve made very simple <unk> to create permanent <unk> , much more <unk> than we were .
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
it also also be in terms of race , which is much more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
we &apos;ve all kinds of <unk> on our essays .
so , we &apos;re entering the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them from few of them ?
while we continue to move our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly going to acknowledge in a zone of the <unk> , where we have to acknowledge that the most of the things that we had probably have been so simple .
we see that in all sorts of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the <unk> , in our culture &apos;s culture , in the united states today , the struggle with the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what dot is a body to people , so that he &apos;s quite quite a different way of the way of the value .
we have very difficult battles -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they have someone to be a feather under the nose , and when they moved , they didn &apos;t bury them yet .
if you don &apos;t moved more , you buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re where we can take people <unk> organs and they want to implant them to other people .
and as a result , we caught ourselves in battle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that makes us really difficult to us , in which we have no longer such a very difficult category .
now you might expect that all of the <unk> of the things that i would really make me happy .
i &apos;m a political <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with extraordinary property , but i have to say , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , it makes us tense .
and it makes us deepening in terms of democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to take the <unk> that i &apos;m a big fan of fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and so much , and so radical , in which they were doing all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> has happened with the <unk> .
the fathers were from my view of the view of the <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
what she was a <unk> concept , and they took it through another , that &apos;s radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our fathers refused to be the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was actually a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the rulers of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who have the political power to have to have these political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> to the father for the son , and so on .
the fathers meadows this idea back and they took them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept that all the people have been created the same .
they <unk> the field of field and decided that <unk> , the common concerns , not the difference , and that was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things in common .
the democracy grew up , but at the same time also , the science grew .
so , if you look at the history of fathers , is clear that many of them are very interested in science , and they were interested in a world of a <unk> world .
they went away from the <unk> of <unk> species , and they kind of <unk> things like an psychic concept of power , back where the transmission of a very <unk> concept of <unk> is based on .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you &apos;re talking about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they made a concept of <unk> common common .
and so they &apos;ve prepared the future civil rights rights .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , women , the <unk> <unk> , the concept of fathers , that says that there are both common more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we should have a <unk> and the right level , etc . , etc .
and women <unk> successfully successfully .
and the next civil rights rights rights , where we were seeing people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> it , &quot; am i &apos;m not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> lines of the <unk> , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are different color of color that are <unk> in any common differences , again , successfully .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we start to look at all the common common , we need to start to ask the question of why we sustain certain <unk> .
now , mind , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you for example , a fish not like to give you the same right .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should be able to go on the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to give you to sex or to get to get married .
so there &apos;s some anatomic <unk> that make sense of me , and we think , i think , should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it &apos;s and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re making sense .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that are <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the same day in 1979 , in the same day .
imagine that one of you , mary , three months of <unk> , she &apos;s born on june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other side , is born to the <unk> , he &apos;s about one of march in 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria three months of <unk> , they would have all the different possible to three months before <unk> -- who &apos;s right to be the right to choose to be right to you .
<unk> needs to wait for all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of its birth .
we find other more <unk> to what their rights are .
<unk> , because it takes the male male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that it &apos;s the mit &apos;s <unk> -- because it &apos;s going to be moved in , and what &apos;s maria is not going to worry about .
maria , on the , not in all states , the same thing , the <unk> in all states has , and that &apos;s right to get to the right ?
<unk> can marry every state a woman , but maria can only get a woman in a few states .
so we have these sustained <unk> categories that are problematic in many ways , and the <unk> .
and for me , the question of what will we do , because our science is doing so much of the world &apos;s anatomy that we can tell you that a point where we have to admit that a democracy that could be based on the anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like that science makes it on its own .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we have to move somewhere else , so we &apos;re going to pull it anywhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , texas , a point , is that you have no y chromosome , and a woman to marry you that you have a <unk> chromosome .
now , people don &apos;t put in their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; &quot; i have a dream of a dream .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be people &apos; after your skin color , but after the animal &apos;s body of their character , &quot; and the way of the anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you see people on their own ?
i also want to suggest that i &apos;m not sure that we should have so on people to so on people because i have to admit that i know a number of golden <unk> , which probably probably are more likely to make people than some people i know .
i want to <unk> , i probably know , i probably know some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , intelligent and more more , to meet your sexual relationships than some of some <unk> i know .
so how are we going to ask the characteristics of the characteristics of the character of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me wonder what would be if the content of a personality would be <unk> in the future -- through fmri ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the u.s. is really leading to think about the question of democracy .
in our effort to democracy , we &apos;ve done our job really well , and i think we would make our job in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation like this in iran , like a man who may become <unk> to other men who are being punished with death , it &apos;s because he &apos;s ready to be in the case he &apos;s going to be alive .
in this kind of nowhere exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to tell you that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon who had talked about a few years ago , who had <unk> twins with <unk> , to separate them , in part to make a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was the <unk> surgeries -- was his answer to be treated in his country , these children would be very bad treated , and so he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , they have an <unk> <unk> of an operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible possibilities to allow people to be able to be able to change the state of the state .
so i think we need to be able to be able to be able to be able .
well , just to conclude , i want to find out that i talked a lot about fathers .
and i want to think about how democracy could look like , or looked like , if we had more involved .
and i want to say something that &apos;s a feminist thing is radical , and i think there could be different ways that could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use different types of the anatomy , <unk> when people are doing a <unk> .
since , i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of the most <unk> .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> is that women , on average -- not any , but on average -- more social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to be very much attention in the group of affairs .
and so , if we think about it , we have a interesting situation before us .
and i asked a graduate student , i asked me one of my <unk> , who knew my interest in feminism known -- i was thinking as a feminist , so it &apos;s -- really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s suffering is the feminism female female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about stereotypes about gender , so that &apos;s why feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
that &apos;s what it might be , it could be something , on average , which is going to tell women &apos;s brains of male different different different from the male and power to <unk> social relationships and <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the fathers were extreme , to find out how individuals were going to protected , it &apos;s possible to be able to be able to protect , we &apos;re protecting a concept of <unk> , not just as you &apos;re protecting , but how we can do for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s what we need to go to the future if we think democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies think about what identity is about the individual bodies , and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i &apos;m showing you what i &apos;m in in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it , to give every chance to find a different <unk> , <unk> outfit , and i &apos;ve also to take a blog and blog in the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of second hand in <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment , and also the ones that goes on .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars is generally for usual purpose ; i think of quite unique , and it &apos;s shopping to my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
am i like to paint color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if everybody says , i feel like i won &apos;t be .
i &apos;m going back to my suitcase , and i &apos;m telling you what i &apos;ve been packing at ted week at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many of the <unk> with so ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven to <unk> , and that &apos;s all of it .
<unk> for a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have bet that i could have anything i could find , if i could just find palm springs .
and since you don &apos;t have heard of me as the woman who runs around in your underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i just want to show you about my favorite health week for this week .
does that sound good ?
and as i do , i &apos;m also going to tell you some of the lessons that i think whether you believe it or not , from those <unk> , nothing new to wear .
let &apos;s start sunday with sunday .
i call the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket has 55 to <unk> , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
<unk> : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad at your own , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
when you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : now , it &apos;s going to be completely <unk> .
i spent a lot of time to try and try to be able to try and be myself , and adapt at the same time .
be simple who you &apos;re .
when you surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just able to understand it , you &apos;re also appreciate it .
wednesday : embracing your inner child .
sometimes i &apos;d say people , i saw as if i was like to do , i think they remember her .
i &apos;d like to smile , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think , you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not good at something that they &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day day .
but only as i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to sum up for a second .
if you believe that there is a wonderful person in and the outside is there , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit , everything .
and finally , saturday : a own unique unique way to develop a different way of creating a great way of telling something about a word without a word .
it was always been able to me and over again , if in this week , if in this week , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversation .
obviously , that &apos;s not all of all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i will donate that again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to do this things , because the right around the corner , it &apos;s always another crazy thing , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which only suggests that i &apos;m waiting for me when i look at a little bit of love .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy is growing in italy with this image in the room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you is , that &apos;s the point that has something that has something very interesting in the last decade .
and before a time ago , that if you wanted to win a formula to win , they took budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , you need , if you want to win a race , actually , like this one -- something that <unk> the car in real time , some thousands of a thousand sensors that are going to be collected and to send things in real time as information as information .
this would be , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start to look at in our lives .
our cities were just been working with networks in the last few years , just with electronics and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in free .
and as computers in free , you start to react to other ways , they &apos;re perceived and propelled them .
when we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way i want to mention is that cities only are two percent of the land of land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the production of the production -- it &apos;s not to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , it &apos;s creating all this sense and drive in the daily life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later in the year , in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , start to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to two , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that &apos;s changed radically the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo shaped the moses , is it the <unk> , and he took him on moses , actually , you can still see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of -- and he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? why are you talking ? &quot;
well today , we start our environment to answer to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of the environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that view .
now the first project i want to think is is in fact one of the first of our lab .
it was about four and four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new kind of network that was used to use the whole world -- this is a <unk> -- and blind and <unk> information from this network , which is actually going to be collected from the operators , to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer in the summer -- 2006 .
it was the <unk> of the <unk> .
some of you will remember it was in italy to be in the office in the <unk> , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter of italy , they won &apos;t end .
now , look at what happened on this day , just the activity of activity that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city here .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
in the morning , the game .
you see the timeline .
in the time , people in the afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy is a portal .
<unk> , people make a little call , go to toilet .
second <unk> . the end of the normal
first extension , second .
<unk> , in a moment of the <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big rash .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister of the time .
and then all down .
you see the image of the space of the space , where , since the <unk> time , people to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the validity at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we couldn &apos;t even have a few years ago .
so , very quickly , another example of life , here is it &apos;s not about people , but in the things we use and consume .
well , today we know all of all of our things .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a a mac , which is how they came together .
but we just know about where the things go .
so , we &apos;ve designed to actually designed some little markers around the garbage as it comes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we &apos;ve helped us , a little more than a year in seattle , the things that they &apos;re in seattle -- different types of things that you can see -- things that they would like .
then we have a little chip , the little brands , the little brands , and they started tracking it .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;re getting right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this piece of information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in doing with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup that we don &apos;t throw away , not just that they &apos;re still anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we just throw away every day .
and if we would show that people , then we can drive a change change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could you even have a lot more about this , and the many other wonderful things you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to tell you to the second part , which we &apos;re in the beginning , and this is the most <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something we &apos;ve done a few years ago , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition of water as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to make new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were in the mit <unk> , was , imagine these tubes , and the valves , <unk> , the valves that open and closing up and close .
they &apos;re not going to make a <unk> with <unk> water .
if these <unk> fall down , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s open to <unk> them , as you can see in this picture .
well , we &apos;ve been introduced the mayor <unk> .
it &apos;s very much like it .
and we got the mission to design a building at the entrance to the expo .
we called it the digital water .
all the building was out of water .
there is no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it &apos;s open and put it in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy if you want to reduce the cracks , you can even leave the roof .
or you could end up the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this case , you know , this one , you know , when you <unk> the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they were devastated the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t actually destroyed the building ; it &apos;s just like the architecture is almost disappearing .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who asks what &apos;s going on inside .
and here , i &apos;m looking at me when i tried to test the sensors that opened water , not getting wet .
now i should tell you what one night happened when you had to work in the same at night .
but actually , it was a little bit more fun .
all the kids came out of the <unk> , to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to let &apos;s open it , but a building that was still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump to jump .
and that was , for us , very exciting for us , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people are using things that we &apos;re designing .
but reality is always <unk> .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projection .
and this is what we took us to think about the following project , i &apos;m showing you now .
so imagine that we could actually start flying .
imagine , you could have little helicopter , who fly through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light , like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a dump , like the one you saw before , the one of the other , is completely in sync with in sync .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> display or display , like this -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but in three dimensions , where the thing changes , the light is , not the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different types .
imagine the screen could just look at different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then , all of this is a 3d cloud of <unk> , which you can walk to walk through and through the way that you can look at many ways .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> to shape like before a <unk> <unk> .
if you turn on the lights , it looks like this , so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person being controlled .
it could have a impulse that every single single impulse is a impulse that comes from people from the movements of people or so forth .
i want to show you something at first .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we have taken his motions in 3d and <unk> them as a impulse for the <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> dancing .
on the left side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all the <unk> , you can play with it and play with color , and play with color , and play .
and that would like to use a possible impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we work .
it &apos;s something that we work for for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going to put people back with something and to change the environment -- almost as we call it , as we call it , as you &apos;re going to make <unk> <unk> like you &apos;re going to move , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation to a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened over the last years , the last decades is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world to a digital world .
that &apos;s all the time , you know , and power it to open through the internet .
now , we can get the first time -- and the campaign administration has shown this -- can we change from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be able to ask us to the challenges -- think about climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually have people involved in the way they &apos;re doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is again , a cloud of <unk> , in the same way , like a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s an physical physical thing in london , but with <unk> .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> &apos;s 2012 and also , and it &apos;s as the relationship to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go to the top of the same thing you can go .
you can go .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist is really important to the relationship .
by my work , i try to say that people are separated from nature and that everything connected .
the first time i was in antarctica , almost 10 years ago in antarctica where i was seeing my first <unk> .
me , <unk> awe .
my heart came to me was <unk> , while i tried to try to try and i was in the point of myself .
the <unk> around me almost nearly 60 feet of water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake at another snowflake year .
<unk> are born as a <unk> of one glacier or by <unk> out of <unk> .
everybody has its own individual personality .
they interact with certain ways with their environment and their experience .
some of them are giving up and brackets to the bitter end , while others couldn &apos;t withstand it and in a <unk> dramatic passion .
if you look at an iceberg , you &apos;re very <unk> , separate and alone , as we often see us often .
but the truth is far away from it .
as an iceberg melts , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere .
as the iceberg melts it puts up <unk> drinking water that feeds many life forms .
i &apos;m going to take my footage of this <unk> as if i would make portraits of my ancestors in consciousness , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments , and never that exist .
it &apos;s not death when it melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> of your <unk> cycle of life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice industry , which i &apos;m very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so the last few pictures i &apos;d like to show you to show you a iceberg that i &apos;ve got in <unk> in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually in a <unk> block .
here you see it .
on the left side , they &apos;re seeing a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts roll , and the boat is moving to the other side , the man is there .
that &apos;s the average size of a <unk> .
he <unk> about 120 feet from water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like , showing you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by working on some amazing projects .
but at the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever been working on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> in the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking , and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood with him .
i have a company that &apos;s design and animations , so that &apos;s actually , is actually a complex part of what we admire in the world and look at attention .
so we decided to tony -- <unk> -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk again with tony .
i just want to leave with him and i asked , &quot; wait a minute , that &apos;s not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all paralyzed people through this gadgets ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;re going to be right to higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i was , &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
does somebody see the film &quot; <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
so , you &apos;re communicating -- so your fingers .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i &apos;d just get a need to go and just a check , and instead i decided i &apos;d not the slightest idea of how i should <unk> it .
i &apos;m going to give you to the place for his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my suggestion is this : tony &apos;s going to be , and we will find a way to make his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who is not going to be in a <unk> , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i was talking about a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from <unk> , and i showed them a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then to draw on a <unk> to draw the very negative surface .
so they &apos;re walking around and make <unk> like this .
they say that all the things that are displayed up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , the <unk> , the <unk> , and then the <unk> , and the final people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life life life in her presentations .
so i went home and ate my wife and ate my wife and told her , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if it &apos;s the technology to use his eyes , that it would be great . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a year , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance , the doors <unk> , and actually , in the <unk> , actually , you know , with a device that he can communicate -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extreme -- i call it <unk> , because you talk about it , or you get an email , and thinks like , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers out of the world -- literally from all the earth -- literally from the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i &apos;ve moved into the garage and the hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
and many of our friends thought that we were beautiful , and we &apos;re beautiful and we all the pictures on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for two weeks we &apos;ve been able to do , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved in venice , my dog and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of venice , and a few things from the hardware and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they <unk> , they &apos;ve set up on a <unk> , and now we can build it in the way , we can build it ourselves , we can download the code for free , you can download it for free .
so we created a device that is completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be insurance .
no hospital .
every paralyzed <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes , or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into <unk> .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of those <unk> in the great revelation of the great revelation .
and after a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> , <unk> nights , <unk> nights , sent back to seven years back to seven years .
and this is an amazing picture because this is his life life system , and he sees out of his life life system .
we &apos;re tired of drinking , so he can see out to see .
we &apos;ve posted an ping-pong table against a wall of the <unk> in the hospital .
and he was able to put back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what was that in the parking lot .
we also had to <unk> , we also had to be in the parking lot of <unk> , so we felt like a part of the <unk> .
and he &apos;s a email to the following with this : &quot; for the first time for seven years since seven years .
i feel that i was getting under water and finally , somebody down to down , and i can breathe and breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s what our <unk> system is like .
that keeps us to the target and keep us on .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
and somebody who has such a tremendous potential , it deserves more .
so we &apos;re in the process of finding out how to make it faster faster and stronger .
since that time we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few prizes .
think about it , it &apos;s free , none of us earned it .
it &apos;s all of our own pockets .
so the more of the people were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , the <unk> is honored as one of the 50 greatest invention of 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s this april , in the downtown los angeles of los angeles , is a show called &quot; the kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there &apos;s pretty much the toughest advocates of the <unk> effects -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all those guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty funky .
so basically , i &apos;m going to see , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this one , this one , that microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and had never been doing something with <unk> , but i just captured something and i &apos;m surrounded with amazing people that we could put something on the legs .
and this question would everybody be asking , and that &apos;s every single day where you have to notice that , if not now , when it ? and if i don &apos;t , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t always tell the people like a scientist .
you can have as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and some of <unk> .
well , a timeline is usually something that you find it out there .
you go around the block and it &apos;s been a revelation .
that &apos;s a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of that i want to tell you today .
and my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the &apos; 60s , in <unk> school , ohio where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who saved every week in the <unk> green and the blue <unk> until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by making the toilet in the <unk> .
they did secretly .
she did three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i got 85 , and it was sent me to san francisco in california -- and i found a lover -- and then i found it to be able to take a work at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call a call from this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man who i know you &apos;ve found it .
and i should say that i have a <unk> , and i want you to go . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they &apos;d be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we were asking them , and we gave them to her family , because it was necessary .
it was something that we did .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know as adults , i was going to know as adults , i got to put it in a box of ash , and he was placed in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and i talked about the revelation of that i spoke .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs to the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned today .
he needs equally -- he needs to be love and love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give you things .
thank you .
imagine a great explosion , while it &apos;s up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this may be scared .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at her right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we would have caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already <unk> and we were so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot is the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it switches to the engine .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the ground .
i didn &apos;t have to talk more about the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was to end .
i want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve learned about myself .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do , and it didn &apos;t actually , all the fences that i wanted to do , and never did .
and while i was thinking about it , i noticed , i noticed , &quot; i &apos;m calling bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is so , and the person is there , i open it .
i want to be completely moving in life .
and that urgency of urgency , this goal , my life has changed .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> the george washington bridge , so pretty much around <unk> -- because i thought , man , there is one thing i really .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i <unk> , i &apos;m going to be better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego .
and i &apos;m <unk> the time i wasted for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people , to people .
and then , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i don &apos;t <unk> more and more with my wife &apos;s <unk> .
it feels great .
i don &apos;t try to be right , right ; i &apos;ll decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and in the sea of the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to be in 20 parts , like you know it from a <unk> .
while we were <unk> , i had this feeling , man , not terrifying .
it &apos;s almost like we were going to prepare our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really really , in a thought that i just have a very wishes .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after this , i went to my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything is a sense of me .
i realized that , by the way that i connected the points in life is just a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life , a good father .
i was faced the miracle of dying in this day .
i got another gift to see , which is to see the future and come back and other different .
my call all the things that are flying today , is imagine , the same thing happens on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , they do that they &apos;re doing , because they think they were there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , they are the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb in iran .
the most important thing that is the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , that &apos;s <unk> .
now if it works to us , the systems of the systems that <unk> and valves , then we can actually have a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can make it , that an effective <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used on a <unk> , to <unk> this gray box , we &apos;re in the business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will jump into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge and the iranian union court to the iranian .
that &apos;s a laundry , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started our research at <unk> six months ago , was completely known what the meaning and the purpose of this was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most <unk> part , the most <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> vulnerabilities of the <unk> use .
and it seemed to be <unk> with these <unk> boxes , this <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of our attention and we started a <unk> project where we were growing up with <unk> infected , and we examined this together .
and then something kind of weird happened .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like a <unk> that didn &apos;t like to get our cheese -- <unk> on it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that &apos;s no sense in my mind .
and after we were experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to me that this is a <unk> attack .
completely , at a particular target .
the <unk> <unk> active on the gray box , if a special configuration was discovered , even if this particular program that it &apos;s trying to be able to do that target .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t matter .
so , the got really my interest and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power plant plant , or a <unk> of germany .
so we should find better out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> code and found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger .
and we also realized that they were very <unk> , by people who had obviously had all the <unk> information to the .
they knew any bits and <unk> that they had to attack .
probably , they even knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you already have noticed that the <unk> of <unk> complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> is a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip of this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code code .
looks pretty much like ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so , what we were looking for the first , we were <unk> <unk> , because we know what they do .
and then we looked for <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring this with the real world -- with potential targets in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could have to prove or to prove .
so , to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s probably in iran , because there were most infections .
now , in this field , there is not multiple goals .
basically , it &apos;s walking out on the <unk> nuclear power plant , and in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to take a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them and <unk> her knowledge to compare the expertise that we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring us to the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor is there is a moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you tamper with the speed of this <unk> , you can actually get the cracks in rotor and even even , to explode it .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was to be able to be slowly and scary -- obviously , to try to despair , so that they cannot be able to be able to be able to be able to be quickly .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of view , by looking at the very data and <unk> .
so , for example , the number <unk> is very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
i started to <unk> scientific literature about how these <unk> were built in <unk> and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it was better .
these <unk> in iran are actually divided into 15 of levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this was great confidence for that we &apos;ve been looking at here .
now , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just like this .
these results were achieved through multiple weeks .
and we &apos;re very often running in a <unk> and we had to collect new .
but in the case , we found that both digital warheads are actually on a and the same target , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and slowed down and down the great <unk> with six <unk> in interaction and manipulated .
so , in large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have , what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- it &apos;s got out of the socks .
down there is the gray box down there , and you see the <unk> .
well , what this thing is , it &apos;s the <unk> values -- so , for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> code that &apos;s been able to be able to be able to do with the wrong with the wrong , right .
and in fact , this false <unk> data from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> is fed up with <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
so the idea of this is obviously not just , the <unk> in the control of the control .
in fact , it &apos;s too much more dangerous and more selfish .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where we need a human <unk> on where it can respond to be quickly enough .
so in a plant plant , for example , if the large <unk> is going to be fast , you have to open up inside milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so , in this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at risk , they can actually happen .
this power power can explode .
and neither the <unk> , even the <unk> is going to notice .
this is frightening .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have anything special to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so he would work right now -- in a power plant , or in a <unk> store .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the predators -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use a standard <unk> technology to get to the <unk> .
you just have to disseminate it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for those attacks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so , all these green areas , these are the most vulnerable environments .
we need to be able to have the consequences and we start to prepare better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported to say that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that the way that you think ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s the <unk> of the things that i think is not israel .
so the driving force is the most flexible superpower .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because it &apos;s not our problem even bigger .
thank you that you have a <unk> <unk> . thanks your ralph .
i spent the last few years to where i find myself where they &apos;re usually very difficult and they &apos;re kind of dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked on a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- it &apos;s hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days to do nothing like this -- i think , a little bit difficult in the middle , a little bit very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most part of my career as a <unk> situation , and all the way to do is really , for the attempt to investigate the social and interesting , and hopefully in a way of ways to understand what they do for the audience and accessible .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to look at a tedtalk and <unk> , i knew i would make something a little bit .
some of you may have heard of this , that i have an ad for a couple of weeks ago .
i sent a few <unk> , some of the <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , and the amazing opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson had never been able to have a title of that , and not many evidence on what the subject was actually .
so what you got was , this is , you &apos;ve been here , this : my tedtalk here , which you don &apos;t have a clue what the subject is going to be , and the way that they &apos;re going to be able to fly and then the inside of the end of the ears , especially if i could look stupid .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at this tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
now if you asked me this one year ago , i couldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with confidence .
but in the new project i work , i &apos;m studying my new film , we study the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;m going to go in some pretty terrible situation , but nothing could be prepared for me , nothing could be so heavy , and so much like with these guys go into a room .
you know , i had the idea of a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , which is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that everything , from the top to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , it &apos;s been <unk> with brands -- from the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see in the film , that &apos;s the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so , the movie is going to study this whole idea -- this is what ? in eternity forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to heart .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to just have the brand x , but we &apos;ll certainly imagine that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category of the movie .
so we &apos;re selling a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever been .
the greatest car they &apos;ve ever been the dangers , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink they &apos;ve ever had to have a attention to the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually , to make it to finance the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing about <unk> .
so that &apos;s all the concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy if the <unk> help help this is to happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be <unk> people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use this point of view , because that has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop this ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth of a <unk> , some really known brands .
who knows who comes out , you may see a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think about how the answer ?
the answer is probably like &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film , or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both .
so , it means not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands do .
yeah .
so if you look at people who you have to do it ...
there are some places we can apply to us .
put the camera .
i thought , &quot; well , imagine the camera of &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out that it meant that it meant , &quot; we want to do nothing with you don &apos;t have to do with you . &quot;
and just so , all of these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do with the film .
i was astonished .
they wanted to do absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought , the whole concept of advertising is to be able to present your product as possible , so many people as possible .
especially in the world today , this intersection of new and old media and the <unk> media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting <unk> , that the crowds are going to bring this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but that &apos;s what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re transparency in the <unk> , this -- this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your kind of sergey , sergey brin .
that was the problem : transparency -- <unk> of deception and <unk> , and it &apos;s just understandable ; of course , characterized and <unk> , and <unk> , and the last line is certainly the biggest issue .
you know , we &apos;re now hearing a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to be implemented , it &apos;s supposed to be done , it &apos;s going to be done .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear that still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s a very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole plate of cool food food .
that &apos;s a risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell these story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father was lying around me -- and there he sits and look at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions .
there is your version , there &apos;s my version , and there are the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only a company that &apos;s been willing to help us -- and it &apos;s because i know john bond , and richard <unk> since years -- i found it alone , and i had to go and go right with my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start to talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand is being understood , a depth of the brand is a depth of a <unk> problem .
i have friends who make big , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends , who are little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , huge <unk> , say that the reason why their movies are so successful at the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> are doing , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the film called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how are we going to see a ban in the movie ?
whenever i do it on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you will see a ban .
and every time i &apos;m when i &apos;m somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh to be the <unk> for this interview ?
are you as ? they &apos;re looking at a little bit nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should be a little bit of the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer a great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re being equipped for men as well as for women -- <unk> , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the <unk> .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a <unk> version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so so , so , you know , you know , people remembers , remember , that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe to describe ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that you &apos;re doing under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; is a great word that really makes us really to make a positive , in contrast , in contrast , and the moisture smell and humidity . &quot;
it &apos;s keeping you fresh .
how can we hold them more longer , better fresh , more fresh , three three times .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and that &apos;s a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to speak with the man on the road , which is like me , <unk> .
they should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like happy clothes .
&apos; 80s <unk> meets <unk> , except on the <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style that i have is , is &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , lots of <unk> and so that stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and stuff .
if dan would be a brand , it &apos;s probably a classic empire .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , is i would say , <unk> fly .
<unk> : partly hippie , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> around the country , the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was <unk> .
<unk> five : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
attorney : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i &apos;m seeing a lot of the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> .
and what &apos;s noticed that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could go into my head , someone who really could help me understand what is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called forged <unk> in <unk> .
they have firms like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for the things , they could help me .
you brought their pictures together , yes ?
i &apos;ve got . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit of just how it &apos;s about your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : the world ? i think the world &apos;s own world is the world that you live in -- like humans around one around , the friends , the way you live , the work , and so on .
all of these things come from and start from a place , and i come from , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what else is that the thought and emotions about them ?
it &apos;s like i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are queer . i like curious things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what brings you ?
what is the <unk> ? what are you now right ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you , that &apos;s not you .
so what else else <unk> do they go through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be scared . in which kind of rollercoaster are ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . now . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what to get out of that .
there was beautiful things that there was a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was was this idea that their <unk> has two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / brand .
so , the soft very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that .
and i think some companies are going to concentrate on a strength instead of both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- not to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to be afraid of , and they &apos;re actually going to be in something positive and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what else else brands do act ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , wii <unk> , mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty potent thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , how would you like ?
they &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that brings blood in your <unk> ?
or are they rather than a <unk> ?
are you something that a little bit quiet , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , profane , <unk> , magic , magic , <unk> .
or are they like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they &apos;ve been doing , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate as the oprah ?
are it reliable , stable , stable , safe , <unk> , <unk> and the other lama of the dalai lama or <unk> ?
and in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that go up and <unk> and the &quot; no , &quot; because they were not part of the project .
they wanted nothing to do with anything with this film because they don &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s been told 17 <unk> , who were ready to get on these control , which was to do with someone &apos;s so appealing and <unk> , and then i think about the stories that we usually have never been able to do -- stories that would never support a <unk> .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> of the <unk> , so we &apos;re using <unk> in this film , that you &apos;re used to use <unk> to the <unk> of the brain , both and to make them as well .
we went to sao paulo where <unk> &apos;s been banned .
in the entire town , for five years , not a <unk> , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school school school where companies are their way to enter their way into the neighborhoods , in all america .
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got to the most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists .
i &apos;m going to work with it and something completely different , something that people think is to think that our view of challenges .
and how did it be done ? what &apos;s it successful ?
now , since the film was beginning to be a film festival , we can see this .
according to <unk> , the first time of january , and since since , and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> from this film .
it actually only one is a half of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no press .
the film was not to be .
there &apos;s not even online , it &apos;s not even online .
he &apos;s not come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film is made a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , which is almost every <unk> that we talked about their client to let their fingers to make it .
what i think is is that if you tickle your chance to take the chance to take risks in these risks .
i think if you get people off , then you get them closer .
i think if you were willing to take the employees to avoid hazards , you &apos;ve prepared for a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to be afraid of options that they might have <unk> .
finally , we should be the fear of fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they &apos;re going to be scared . they &apos;re welcome to the risk .
so we &apos;re fully careful each of the great taste so we &apos;re going to be welcome .
and finally , we should be called transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit of a bit of a little bit more .
and that is , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; is called transparency , &quot; was presented with my good friends of <unk> , who <unk> $ <unk> to <unk> on ebay .
great data is going to be transformed for organizations around the world in great opportunities .
<unk> : &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , the transparency of this : what is now right with the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket check , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in altitude <unk> to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
i was doing something else in google months ago , and i <unk> to do something with museums and art . my favorite <unk> , who are now , i was a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the slide .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and you &apos;re explaining to your access .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education in the case -- i didn &apos;t <unk> myself -- but i had no access to many museums and this artwork .
and when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- art more complicated -- to do with technology together .
we then started a team , a great crew , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you &apos;re just going to be able to <unk> .
you can look around all these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , van gogh .
i &apos;m even in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of the art of new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and so forth .
they want to be <unk> in the museum ?
open the map , and jumping them with a click .
in fact , they &apos;re like to be , they want to end up until the end of the .
just keep . much fun .
through them .
thank you , but the best thing is still .
so now i &apos;m a <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
so this is one of the images .
so , these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click on here , but i click it now .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve got to the so-called <unk> .
this picture for example , about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you .
you can be very easy in and <unk> .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they want to really want to go .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , this sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the , and i realized that these kids actually would like to do something .
i &apos;ve been a little bit , i talked about some known with some known at the met , and actually , in fact , it &apos;s a game called <unk> , where a <unk> is beaten on a stick with a stick .
it seems to be popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really , to really go to the <unk> .
just to give you the <unk> , i &apos;m going to see you what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump to moma quickly , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
so , in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see a van gogh of this masterpiece to a masterpiece ?
you put in it . you can actually go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in a <unk> of this picture , until i really am at the rubble .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there is still many other , but i &apos;m missing time .
that &apos;s really cool part , he &apos;s called the collections .
everybody of them , everybody -- the same is rich or poor , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
they can create a look online online online , and we &apos;re creating a lot of these pictures , you can put your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can see <unk> .
this is the <unk> &apos; s , in the <unk> .
you can put it all with <unk> , you know , and so a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , to conclude , is the main thing that all the wonderful things can &apos;t come from google .
and i think , i think , after the museums .
i may not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience of humility to me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art , and it &apos;s perfectly <unk> .
and it &apos;s the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asking for me , &quot; did you do to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s meant to introduce the experience .
that &apos;s how it goes . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be transmitted into two .
that &apos;s the left half , the <unk> page is , and then the right half of the side is the intuitive page .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of each hemisphere , we could show your brain .
for example , this one is , it would be completely logically .
this would be someone that &apos;s completely intuitive .
well , where would you get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have been one of the extremes , but i think that most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , which is in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re <unk> and so forth .
you can be logically and intuitively .
and so i &apos;m looking at one of the people , in common with the most other experimental <unk> , which needs a good amount of logic to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually carry the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play and look at it and look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the hunches that you &apos;ve evolved over the years is probably that one thing can be at the same time only in a place .
i mean , it can sound strange about it , that one thing at the same time in two different locations , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve evolved .
i remember a kid playing on a <unk> .
he was a toddler , and not very good at it , and he fell down .
but i bet that it &apos;s going to be a very valuable lesson with the <unk> , which is the great things that we &apos;re not going to be by , and you &apos;re in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> because they &apos;re not playing with <unk> , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with their particles , they &apos;re all kinds of odd things -- how they &apos;re flying through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the one of the physics of the number of years ago , and you took quantum mechanics to describe quantum mechanics to describe quantum mechanics .
but you don &apos;t need it to describe the great mundane objects around us .
that has my intuition , not like , and maybe because i don &apos;t have a lot of games with particles .
well , i &apos;m sometimes games with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them yet .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but my logical logical page has no liked .
because if all of things out of particles are made and all those particles , the rules of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t just the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s not like this .
so i would feel better with all of the things if we could somehow show that <unk> also follow the mechanics of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , and i was doing exactly what it .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal over the same .
that &apos;s an image of the object .
here &apos;s something that &apos;s going to expand . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really very big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal to it is a springboard and it &apos;s about the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours to all the big devices .
and for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this one <unk> pool in the hole and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it needs a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how do it uncomfortable to be in an elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of odd things , but then different people , and i &apos;m hearing all these things because i don &apos;t want to do it , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so mechanics says that <unk> objects are equally comfortable .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not only humans , but also the light that seems to shine and the wind that it seems to be over to you and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we were seeing that this piece of metal <unk> , we had to <unk> the whole <unk> out .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we put the light off , put it in a vacuum and <unk> all the air and <unk> it up to almost , entirely in the elevator , the piece of metal <unk> was to act like it .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it moves really strange .
instead of it &apos;s just calm because it &apos;s just a <unk> , it &apos;s about like this , like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and we could give it a little push , we could actually make it up at the same time , and not to vibrate -- something just that is the quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what truly awesome .
what is it to vibrate and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms that are the piece of metal are still there and the same time moving the same atoms and down .
just too precise <unk> voices .
the rest of the time they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is the same time , that the whole piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s cool right .
really .
that &apos;s worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , you see , the <unk> between a single atom and that piece of metal , and that piece of metal is about as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom of the same time can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ?
i mean , this is just what my logical idea is to say .
so , imagine , they would be at the same time in several places , how would that feel like ?
how would your consciousness deal with that your body is in the room ?
there is another aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in reality , just most powerful objects that are <unk> in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how mechanics says , and quantum mechanics says , everything is connected .
now , that &apos;s not really right .
there &apos;s more than it , it &apos;s still more .
it &apos;s so that these compounds , their compounds to all around the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be <unk> as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , you &apos;ve given to the opportunity to choose between at least one hand of different cities that are all in competition to get new people .
we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that are not even a single city that they &apos;re going to be .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs them .
so we could actually very simple with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
this may sound like an absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
so , they just move the construction from apartments against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in home , this is already , but the other one of them don &apos;t yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of the time to expand the capacity of the time .
but you know what they would be about to be in those homes , in those apartments and their environment rule laws of avoiding complaints and to turn off the <unk> .
so it turns out as a very difficult to all of these <unk> .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block block , so we would have provided the laws of buildings and not <unk> it .
so i suggested that governments can create new surfaces that are enough place for a city and have given them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> , and the challenge of a reform crisis in honduras .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 <unk> , their country to take care of the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and they can &apos;t the same in honduras .
this is a <unk> to <unk> , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> area of our country , and if we just have a message of the most canadian message ; you have to work on the area of this messages , which they would be going to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , honduras under a fierce <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a turnaround whose program would be both innovative , and also <unk> .
he challenged <unk> to become <unk> .
in the meantime , i was preparing myself at tedglobal at tedglobal .
in improvement , try and from the study of consumers , i tried to try this complicated concept of the <unk> city on the essentially <unk> .
the first thing is the importance of laws , laws that are the fact that you can &apos;t be able to be able to pay out of existing <unk> .
we have great attention to new technologies , but for the progress , it needs technologies and laws and they are generally , they were complaining .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent to the link to the tedtalk .
and again showed him <unk> .
the two started me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami , and in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to do clear how valuable cities are , to make how much more valuable they are as they costs .
and i used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is to a place like new york , and think that a surface in some cases , per square meter thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion at a place when there was a pause when there was a pause , <unk> said , &quot; paul , may we be able to look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form , that a <unk> city is a place , its beginning is a <unk> , a <unk> that defines the laws that govern there and the people who have the opportunity to decide , either of those rules , or not .
so i was asked by the president of peace who meant that we have to do this project that it &apos;s important to do , and that it &apos;s the way to bring us to our country .
i was asked to go to <unk> , and even the fourth and fifth january of january a lecture .
so i &apos;ve given another with facts <unk> talk to the chart of this involves a graph that has to try to ensure that if you &apos;re going to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in the <unk> .
in order alone , this airport has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to convince the <unk> of it , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
deceive you all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and alert .
the head of congress came on the stage , and i said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him here on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
and i came to the answer that there is a new city of people to offer new possibilities .
there was the opportunity to live in a city that would be , instead of a city of <unk> , instead of north from miles away .
and a new city includes new possibilities for leaders .
the executives of the government would be on the aid of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could benefit from the laws of the laws and to support that everybody can trust that the charter really is really .
and the discovery of president <unk> was that the <unk> of the most <unk> that i thought about as a way to get the foreign investors and to build this city , which could be <unk> to build the <unk> for all parties that have been gripped for fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field .
this is a picture of this place .
it &apos;s just a thousand square miles .
and shortly afterwards , on the 19th of january , they have been voted for the change in the constitution to have a <unk> of the world that &apos;s special <unk> .
in a country that has been a intense crisis behind itself to congress to congress to the <unk> of this <unk> to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported it .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be authorized twice by congress .
on january 5th , it was authorized to a voice of a voice .
according to this choice between the 21st and 24 february , one delegation of about 30 <unk> in the two places in the world who were most interested in the business of the <unk> .
the place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new downtown downtown , which is built in south korea , <unk> great as the center of the center of the city .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took the permissions to get the permissions to get the permissions .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
there were already built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> ; and it &apos;s considered this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that allows us to participate , and it &apos;s also working on a external legal system .
a country has already offered its supreme court court as the court for the <unk> appeal to the local <unk> system .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually bring to a sponsor .
one thing , as you already know , there &apos;s been there , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are lots of businesses who like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who &apos;d like to live there .
around the world there are 700 million people who say they want to live in a way to live in a different place .
one million people left every year every year and migrate into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to leave their families to work , they &apos;re sometimes , who are the single mothers who have to earn enough money to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
unfortunately , sometimes kids are sometimes able to find their parents back to find their parents , which they have seen in some cases , since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to build on the <unk> to build a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or are distributed to build hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between a single world that are in competition to get new people ?
that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from students have asked me to say , thank you .
do you know how many decisions do they do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a poll for a couple of 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are the <unk> <unk> of a single american americans in a day .
and also , recently did a study trial had done with ceos in which they saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists have just documenting the various topics that this ceo is preoccupied with the time and how much time they were making decisions who relate to the topics .
and they found that an average ceo in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these topics was made of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were born within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of your decisions needed an hour or more than more .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you in the nine minutes is to meet the one hour of the one hour ?
how good , think , are you going to make the choices at the ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
and if i ask you a question , you put up , i &apos;m blind , just your hand , if you want to burn a few calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question for today is you &apos;re willing to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford at stanford , i went to this very <unk> convenience stores , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store , the <unk> &apos;s name .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different types of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different species of water -- and that was at a time we &apos;re actually drinking <unk> .
i loved it to go to this business , but at a moment , i asked myself , well , how do you have never a little bit of <unk> ?
here &apos;s the oil .
they had 75 different varieties of oil , including those who were locked in boxes that came from a thousand years old <unk> .
so i decided to visit a day , and i asked the head , &quot; this model , that you really offer the people all of these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists that came every day and they would usually have their cameras .
we decided to company an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gait .
they had <unk> different types of <unk> .
we &apos;ve put a little <unk> directly on the entrance to the <unk> .
we have six different tastes <unk> or 24 different tastes <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , you know , i think ?
there are more people who are , when it &apos;s 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what people were doing rather a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and from the people who were 24 , they were only only three percent of them in a glass .
by the people who were in six , they were now , now , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
well , if you calculate it , you really , you really , the people who really did a glass of <unk> who they had six to offer when they had 24 of the selection .
now , don &apos;t buy a glass of <unk> , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> of us influences us to be very potent .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even if it &apos;s about our best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were looking at the decisions for retirement , from nearly a million americans from about <unk> plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> that were possible to be able to be able to have the <unk> plan , the likelihood of being saved for tomorrow .
and we found out that there was a correlation in the fact .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans to the people who offered anything between two to 59 .
and what we found was that the more fund was that the more fund was that the was actually part of the amount of participation .
now , if you look at the extremes of the <unk> , the plans , the two fund , had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that &apos;s almost 60 fund , the <unk> came up to about the <unk> <unk> .
now , imagine that even if you were to participate in the <unk> , if more choices were to give up , even the negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more likely to participate , the more choices they were available , the more defending it stocks and fund .
the more choices they were available , the more they would put their whole money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , is to make the choices that someone recommend when you recommend your future resource well-being matters .
well , in the last decade we &apos;ve seen people &apos;s greatest fundamental consequences that provide the offer more and more choices with themselves .
they make the decision to -- push it on , even if it &apos;s best in their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial resources and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to ask yourself less comfortable , even if you make it objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy , we may enjoy this huge column of <unk> , <unk> , oil and <unk> , but we actually can &apos;t move those comparisons and environmental numbers , and then actually have something made out of the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different <unk> -- they can just apply them in the business .
first , just to be .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as today , that less than today .
people are always disturbed when i say , &quot; just . &quot;
they always worried that they &apos;re losing losing .
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to narrow yourself , and the <unk> of the things going to go , now , then you &apos;re going to cut it , then you &apos;re going to cut the cost , &amp; amp ; and there is a improvement improvement .
so as a <unk> and gamble , the different head and <unk> , on 15 times , they had a five-meter increase in the country , it &apos;s about 10 percent .
as the golden <unk> corporation , her 10 to <unk> <unk> , they &apos;ve been <unk> by 87 percent <unk> -- a result of the one of the increase in the increase of the increase .
you know , the average <unk> is today , is sharing your <unk> products .
so if you &apos;re going to have a typical wal-mart , you today , 100,000 products .
but the most <unk> supermarket , who is <unk> in the world today , and they &apos;re just providing as 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a a a cluster .
now in the world of the <unk> , i think one of the best examples , the recently have come to the market , how to the best choices , was something that david <unk> has very strong <unk> , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s been offered at harvard .
every single at harvard employees takes automatically at a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice will be offered to be about 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m asking the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to burn them , it can &apos;t be their customers . &quot;
well before we &apos;ve had lunch now , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer a <unk> vacation to the nicest road in the world &apos;s most beautiful road .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read you , and i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re ready to start to embrace .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to embrace gary &apos;s offer .
is that all ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact that you think about it is an objective , the first time more information , as a second time , but i would choose to guess that they were able to see it .
because the pictures were made it real .
what i brings to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between possibilities , to understand what are the implications with the individual possibilities , and that these consequences are vivid and specific to be specific .
why are people going to be about 15 to 30 percent more if you use a <unk> or a card card ?
because it &apos;s not that the money .
and it turns out that if you make it something that it &apos;s a very good tool , so you can get people to save more .
so , we have a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we made a study with people with <unk> -- employees who were all for the <unk> -- and those people were all at a rally in which they ended up their participation for their <unk> .
and during this session , we &apos;ve been doing this session , as they always just do it , just we added a little bit .
the thing we have on the <unk> , we &apos;ve been asked to think of the people just to think of all the positive things that would happen if they would save money .
and in that , we did this simple thing , there was a five-meter rise of participation in about 20 percent , and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save or a increase in four percent of the amount of the amount of food that they were ready for the <unk> .
the third technology : <unk> .
we can deal with more more than more than with more than more choices .
here &apos;s an example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> up and down the northeast of the northeast , and the number of <unk> different kinds of magazines to the <unk> .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and i &apos;m going to show you in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and then they think these in 20 categories , then they believe that i had given them more choices and a better <unk> , and i &apos;ve given them to give them a better <unk> .
because the class i &apos;m going to hold apart .
here &apos;s two different types of <unk> .
one is called jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> , and the display on the right , you clap in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple of .
if you think that on the left side of jazz is , and the one on the right side is <unk> , then you please .
okay , a couple more .
well it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is highly <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> have to say something to make a difference , not that the selection .
and this problem is often , if you look at the long list of this fund .
who is you to do it ?
my fourth technology : the premise of complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we &apos;re just to simplify them .
we need to raise the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who gives you the ability to <unk> your car completely .
they have to make these different different decisions to design their car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that offer them a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i got 56 possibilities .
motors , gear -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing is , i change the order of making the decisions .
half of the customer is going to be done by many possibilities , 56 <unk> to the low possibilities , four gear .
the other half of the customers is about low possibilities , four gear , to the 56 , many possibilities .
what i &apos;m looking at ?
how am they interested .
if you use the <unk> of the time , that &apos;s that they &apos;re being paralyzed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that the people who go from the many of the very low <unk> , and they &apos;re going to choose the <unk> .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they stay in the .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is is changing the order to change this information .
so when i start with the simple , i &apos;m like i &apos;m like to <unk> .
even though the gears of the gear , i don &apos;t get to tell me anything about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still going to take me on it .
it &apos;s also taken me for a lot of the big product that i <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to get to help me with interest in the way .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that <unk> <unk> -- narrow -- they &apos;re going to be able to get the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- they &apos;re doing it real ; -- we can get better with more categories , less possibilities .
so every of these techniques that i &apos;m describing to show today is to help you the possibilities to help -- good for you , they can use them for yourself , well for people who are providing service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re using choice .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i &apos;m looking at the <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are <unk> , and then , why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , <unk> -- when i was young , it seemed so much so complicated .
but <unk> , that allows us to all of us all of our creative work , and are very popular in one part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the internet .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours a minute uploaded .
again , just a tiny percentage ever ever <unk> and get a thousand times and the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , we want to get .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year <unk> <unk> <unk> this video he filmed his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was been seen for 23 million times in 2010 .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video last summer was popular for the first time .
actually , not a viral video didn &apos;t want to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re <unk> mountain <unk> .
he had uploaded every lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually sent to january in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there were jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that &apos;s popular as popular as popular .
because <unk> like <unk> <unk> , to make us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> &apos;s getting down on <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> .
rebecca <unk> : is one of the popular video of the year .
it was looked for nearly 200 million times this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like the &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; seem to be made out of nowhere .
what happened in this day ?
well , it was friday . it &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> it on , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson was a first of the <unk> science theater was a first one that made a joke .
so important is that an individual or group of <unk> a shoes of <unk> has taken a <unk> of a great audience and to <unk> the process .
then these community community formed to people who shared these great <unk> , and started to talk about it and playing with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single day of day .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the part of our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by the way we &apos;re spreading it or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , just .
this year , it was nearly 50 million times .
and if you think that for a crazy , you &apos;d know that there is a <unk> of that , which has been seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
it &apos;s important , creativity that are in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there were remixes .
somebody made an outdated version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> fired out of the ground , which made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find it very much of what we do with .
who would have done all of this thing ?
who would have &quot; double &quot; <unk> black or &quot; <unk> black or &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot;
what <unk> did you can write in which is that kind of <unk> ?
in a world , in the every minute two days of video is going to be uploaded , only is just a unique and unexpected <unk> like the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the
i admit i wasn &apos;t really interested in my , as a friend told me to see this great video about a fellow who protested in new york against the day .
i got a ticket ticket because i &apos;m not going to be on the <unk> , but often , there are disabilities that are not going to be a decent agenda on the <unk> .
because that was completely surprising and humorous was , was a casey was thought about five million times .
this approach is true for anything that we do .
and that &apos;s all the big question to us ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creativity , entirely unexpected , the features are a new kind of new kind of media and culture , and the audience is defined and in the audience .
like , one of the currently largest stars -- justin bieber -- he was a beginning to youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
and today we all feel like owners of our culture .
and that &apos;s not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not making them not to the media from today , but they will determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about 10 minutes about the bond between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness in life of a four-year-old girl , <unk> , and never vanished -- this little girl who live in san francisco and today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be compiled .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who doesn &apos;t take his life &apos;s work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose life was made by the simple hope of the very simple hope and liberty of his home .
imagine it <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , as he says to god must be a single one .
the words , so long his friends , <unk> of his friends .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broke through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never met it personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot to be forgotten his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to <unk> us , but it &apos;s going to be out of it .
the next <unk> of the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> was quiet on lake .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , and with two little girls .
for her life , you have a job , the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely <unk> that they could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat on the lake as <unk> .
all of adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear had pirates and ugly , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was a little <unk> on .
and in a <unk> , my sister and i , then , you know , and my grandmother &apos;s grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the motor , the clapping of each wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came out many times , but from the <unk> of men on our boat , or the <unk> of the motors that had not been going to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> of the <unk> coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first <unk> that was one of the men .
no apple ever put in that way .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations that are building together a new life together .
we were down in <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> talks , whose population is made out of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence was entirely known to me , was not a <unk> .
the smell smell coming from the <unk> coming out of the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> were brought in between people , and they were shared by people who had been in common .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line of a <unk> , six days , twice the layers of <unk> .
it somehow could find the time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been assigned and i was put in other training for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do , and mostly the new things came up to be out of second .
two <unk> for school , each of the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here and there &apos;s &quot; season , &quot; season , go home . &quot;
after home ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting and a quiet voice , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day and listening to the movements of our grandmother .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake until their <unk> came , so i could get her <unk> .
she opened a <unk> , then it took a <unk> and a business .
and women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , caught between two worlds .
<unk> and sponsors were been looking for .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one i was the classic asian asian student , who has <unk> demand itself .
in the other , i was involved in uncertain life , the tragic scars of violence carrying the tragic scars of violence and the <unk> .
but so many got the help .
and because of this aid , i was <unk> by the <unk> of the year as a young <unk> of the year .
and i was taken from a <unk> to the nearest <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t match .
tan le <unk> <unk> , was now <unk> le , and <unk> and social , who had never heard of places , and in habitats , whose existence they never could have imagined .
i was not familiar with the computer company .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into a routine and the comfort of a unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were so <unk> every single day of their day and <unk> , we were still in the same bed .
i said i &apos;d not do that .
and she reminded me that i was so old as they were flying at the time .
no one was a way .
&quot; just do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and not , what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all of the <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , they lived on the bounds of the possible .
and even though i had a degree i realized that i couldn &apos;t come to <unk> with a career in law .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something you must be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead so easy to collapse of the artery , so easy to be so easy to be accepted the assumptions of the surroundings .
i &apos;ve been enough of my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as you &apos;re doing it .
possibilities that didn &apos;t have been to be explicit in believing .
there was a energy , a optimism bias , a strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> .
so i came to my gut .
i collected a little team of people to me , for the <unk> , &quot; not a <unk> challenge .
a year we had no dime for a year .
at the end of an every day every day i took a huge orthodox soup that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant and we were able to get the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull out to the u.s.
after just a trip there .
my gut room again .
three months later , i was moved to and the adventure went on .
before i &apos;m going to <unk> the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time in the <unk> of social norm and local mandarin mandarin .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
your mother moved alone .
and i was 17 to her second woman , she was her mother .
no , her husband was worried for a <unk> , by having it in a trial and she was <unk> in her own case , and a larger <unk> when she won .
&quot; not , &quot; proved to be <unk> .
i just walked in a hotel in sydney when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and saw it on the other side .
i knew she came to say goodbye to me .
my mother phoned me a few minutes afterwards .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple , in <unk> and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and <unk> , that we were still in her .
so , to midnight , the monk came and said he to end the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s since she &apos;s in the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t just your mind . &quot;
if it &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s where the women .
see who we were , and how life has been formed , we can now see that the men who would be made in our lives , we would have come to the <unk> .
it was just to be too easy .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think that &apos;s the boat .
who would ever be ?
yes , i was scared about privilege , ease in front of <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave <unk> wave , the <unk> , <unk> of the engine , the vast faraway , who doesn &apos;t have no doubt ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it , and it could be safe to do it , i would do it .
and also , <unk> is a mother &apos;s mother today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it a photograph of photography ?
because that &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t absorb with his camera .
and yet , my interest in photography , when i got my first digital digital digital lab was at age 15 years .
i put it with my earlier <unk> for the way , but it was a little bit different because it was using the camera in planning .
and if you put a picture with a camera , the process , the process , if you press it .
so , for me , it seemed to be more about to go to the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to the process when the trigger is .
photos like this : a site , a lot of <unk> road .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and <unk> still a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all the common target to keep a realistic level .
when i say , my <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you really can actually capture , but i &apos;d like to look like it as if you could have that it would be , in a photograph .
and i think of the photos that you need to think about a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about to capture an idea of it , a moment .
so what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details , or the colors ?
is it going to be the light ?
what does the illusion ?
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how to make the world , and how it can be made in a two-dimensional material .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have a perfect physical objects here , we can identify all in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , you can combine something that &apos;s still in <unk> that it could exist .
but at the same time we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains because our brains don &apos;t really simply make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that i think is realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about the things around us in our lives .
but if we &apos;re going to combine some pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it because otherwise they &apos;re just going wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not three special images .
so , you can start doing something special like this .
so the first rule is that the other people should have the same perspective .
two , the other photos should have the same <unk> .
and these two pictures they meet these two requirements -- they were snapping the same height and the same <unk> .
third is about making it impossible to make it possible , where the individual images start and end up with them seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to say , as the photograph actually got compiled .
so , by example , you &apos;re contrast , in contrast and the surface of individual images , photographic <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we &apos;re looking at the borders between the different images and so , although a picture of basically have hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is just a landscape and the bottom part was manipulated .
this image is completely composed of a completely composed of photos of different places .
i personally personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into a dent with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i needed this idea in winter , i knew i needed to do several months to try to get to work on the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the shore is from a different place .
the <unk> is from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house on the island of red <unk> to look at it .
to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s going to be able to go from so many of a <unk> .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very good job .
and if you make good footage , it can be pretty nice , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so , so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think that the most important thing is that we stopped talking to talk to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at the <unk> is , it &apos;s a <unk> to do .
and this is not particularly scientific -- you imagine a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patient , families , relatives , relatives , &quot; how are it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the problems that all -- you know , maybe most of the electronic <unk> crash , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button on .
and every morning i jump on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i mean , i have my job to 95 pounds of it .
it &apos;s just like , every time i jump to the scale , you can also send my data at google health .
and there &apos;s also , you &apos;re also going to see from my <unk> , so that he can see where my favorite life is , and not just at the moment i need to do , but it &apos;s also with a view of the past .
there is something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve been on twitter <unk> on twitter .
so i jump to my <unk> and people talk to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; for lunch , rather just a little bit of lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but that &apos;s the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it could be used to smoke .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and to bring them to play some kind of game to control their health better .
and then , next week comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> to an iphone or so <unk> .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to take it to their doctor , and to share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
so , the patients get the patients in the game . they can &apos;t just take over control , of the <unk> on your own ship , but can help health care of the challenges that we are , and the most health care of healthcare , the need to demand and so on .
make them very easy to use , and start with this to be patients in the team .
and that can achieve these things , but also through crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we all know exactly where all the atms around the <unk> of the world have been around .
we still know one where all petrol stations .
and we can see , we can find out of the <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving <unk> had been in this moment .
so , what did we did ? we &apos;ve done collusion in the netherlands .
we set up a website and a <unk> company , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where he &apos;s when he &apos;s , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed as a closed .
and over 10,000 <unk> , already in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we designed a <unk> machine .
we have an app for <unk> , distributed reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and somebody &apos;s going down , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can save the next to find the next to the next time , to save lives .
and today , we don &apos;t want to just like to do this as a <unk> as the product is called , but also as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , so that helps us to behave like <unk> , to celebrate these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and somebody &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s your own relationships or somebody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing , we want to ask for companies to help us in the world for <unk> in the world .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its place .
please help us and try to improve health , and to take care of your own .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discovery .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> , that we &apos;re going to force us to change .
... it gives us to give up to crowdsource .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh , a moment .
it may take it until it &apos;s been pissed .
now , we can just jump that -- i &apos;m just going to jump the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is already ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to take the stars in technology and design to get out a year , and work in a environment that are so much everything that they really hate , we have them in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> of engineering .
we choose a few fellows every year and we &apos;re going to work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , worked with urban collaborators .
but what they really do is to show what is possible with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
here &apos;s what he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for , somebody who really is , is somebody who &apos;s <unk> , when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at <unk> when he &apos;s a meter of <unk> .
how did he come to look for this particular way of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston , the code for america for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> .
and they realized that the city never <unk> these fire fires .
but one particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , found something else , and that was that the inhabitants of sidewalks in <unk> , right in front of these parts .
so he did what everybody was doing good developers , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> it free to <unk> if it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t make it , you can take it off .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other <unk> .
it &apos;s expanding rapidly .
so , this guy is in the <unk> division of the city of the city that has seen that he could use this app not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check it .
and then , the seattle decided , seattle , the app to use to get the citizens to get the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago has been introduced to the people who <unk> the <unk> when it was <unk> .
we now know nine cities , the planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s been <unk> , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it &apos;s not going to be so on .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston , for three people two months months .
it was a way to find out with the parents , which are the right public school for their children .
we later told that if it would go over the normal channels , it would have taken it over two years and it would cost it over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
there are a project in the california &apos;s project , which has cost the benefits to two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so , an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it turns out of <unk> is actually a shot in front of the <unk> in the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think they should think that they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , that &apos;s open and productively .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , the thing about this app is that she represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of the government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a really good news , because it turns out that we are very well in the collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to do in order to tackle things effectively .
it &apos;s not just the code for america for america , there are hundreds of people around the country that are sitting up and <unk> , everyday , everyday communities in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re awfully frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t fix it .
and these guys know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s where you all the feelings of the politics and the snake and all the other things that we &apos;re really upset about is , is government , in the heart , in the words , &quot; what we do is we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have been given up .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i &apos;m you that you &apos;re going to change things .
politics change is not ; the government is in the change .
and because the government would ultimately be their strength to us -- <unk> you : &quot; we people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it &apos;s been mainly about the government of the government to choose in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve got to end that it &apos;s mostly in the local communities in the world .
this is the call center for service and information .
they usually come out when you <unk> in your city .
if you ever have the chance to work in your <unk> call work , like our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re going to call it all of many different problems , including , in fact that a <unk> in your house .
scott gets this <unk> .
you type &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official database .
and he &apos;s not really an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just see all the doors in your house and see it and see if the cattle is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause and that &apos;s applause .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t written this app .
this is a very bright people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is a proper report -- it &apos;s been in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott talk to human being a human being .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; is everything in public , so that everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we got was , &quot; i went over there , and i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . <unk> .
and the <unk> is on the side . went home .
good afternoon , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here is the digital digital .
and it &apos;s a good example of how the government is to get into the <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i mean , not necessarily , i &apos;m not necessarily a technological definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizens , but the government was a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have able to connect them with state performance if this needs would be a <unk> , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to the services .
if a neighbor of the other helps us , we strength to our communities .
call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contributions to the system is to choose .
how often we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we rebel , and we expect that the government and our needs and it &apos;s a lot of things , and then not have changed much ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean and politics that are the top of the top .
and what &apos;s happened is , what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with this kind of contempt .
but it &apos;s this kind of thing that we own , and we &apos;re paying for the to be something that we &apos;re working on us , something different , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we need to make the bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the real place is happening .
we have to be involved in the design of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of <unk> citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is a answer to the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> .
it &apos;s not politically active , that &apos;s what is active .
well , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world that we want to leave our kids .
you &apos;ve got to ask the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we can achieve what we need to do without improving the institution that we can act in the name of us ?
a government is necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible to make it possible , the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by making the society .
and there is a generation that have grown up the <unk> internet , and the white that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the right systems .
now the average age of your fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation than most of them .
this is a generation that has grown up with the voice of granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting , who &apos;s going to talk to who are speaking to be able to speak .
you can make your mind , to every channel every time , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of the government , they don &apos;t care so much to use their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that the work of government is improved .
and these apps we use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire hydrant , a fire , a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> turn .
and sure , we would have been able to <unk> those fire back to the whole time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government to pay taxes and win .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve government to improve until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all here for you here : if it &apos;s about the big important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re only going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role in the way of explaining how wonderful the new technologies that are the <unk> , and i thought i &apos;m going to keep up with this incredible <unk> , that we can &apos;t keep up with it .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a little bit , boring slide .
... you can show you a little bit .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen to be selected by my name .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather around the universal form .
this slide shows data data from us compared to the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide is , as many other , which we find in our field often , a way on a <unk> curve .
in other words , everybody &apos;s one is the one of the power in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
so this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you can turn the light back again .
there &apos;s something a little bit brighter because i &apos;m drawing something on the paper .
now , why did we draw diagrams in the technology on the curves ?
the reason for this is when i would draw it on a normal curve , where , we say , this is the timeline of a <unk> of technology that i want to do with a graph , then the graph is silly .
so that &apos;s like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;re going to say a <unk> , then , that &apos;s going to be a very <unk> scale , very <unk> , in a flat line .
but if something like this , it changes the <unk> conditions .
so if the <unk> were so quickly as the <unk> of the <unk> , we could go into a taxi and 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
that was never before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is increasing the scale of exponentially .
so the question i want to ask you is if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is forever and so quickly as well as now evolved .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new is going to be , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s what it is about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think so something is going to happen in the way here .
it &apos;s really like that , we &apos;re here in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world in a new way of the world .
so the question i want to ask and i &apos;m also a place , and i &apos;m also going to be able to be this new world ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 and people who often have talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you find it that the future still lies in 2000 .
we &apos;re going on , we don &apos;t go .
in other words , the future is a year after a year , has since i &apos;m in the world .
i think the reason for this is we can realize that there is something happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that it &apos;s simply simply not to do a sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years in the future because it &apos;s so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now is simply not make sense .
now i want to talk about what this is , this is that we &apos;re in the moment .
so , to do this first talk about some other things that really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think that to really understand this , we need to step back and look at the point of a long time .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life of life .
i think the whole picture makes sense if you split it into a few of <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s a billion years of the earth , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
so if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then it gives us a pretty good image about how they <unk> the <unk> .
and i think there are theories that start to understand how everything has been rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story of that time , which is , that &apos;s different types of chemicals in their own .
some of these <unk> contain in a special combination of chemicals that allow them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow so .
all of those were so , started to divide .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> in the senses .
but they were not about living in the same way , alive in the present sense , because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they evolved to <unk> chemicals in the <unk> of these .
so every <unk> was a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> , which had been a for growth <unk> <unk> faster than other and more integrated and more chemicals from the outside and divided faster .
so , these are longer to survive longer and they &apos;re growing into the <unk> of disease .
so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but it &apos;s interesting to be , if this <unk> learned a trick about abstraction .
in any ways that we don &apos;t really understand is that this <unk> has learned the ability to have information <unk> .
they &apos;ve learned to store the prescription of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this <unk> , evolutionary ways that allowed them to do , <unk> what they were able to put it and copied this information .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is that the way of the time of a billion years , where they came in , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that every organism is using exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re just like we &apos;re just to write just for the <unk> , to the point of this code .
and i have a hundred <unk> of a white <unk> , which i try to keep in airports away from <unk> .
it &apos;s in there -- what i did is , i took this code -- the code is from normal letters that we use to the <unk> -- and i &apos;ve written my favorite <unk> on a piece , and it &apos;s 10 ^ 22 times more .
so if someone wants to want a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was really a <unk> , i would have been written in a virus , and it &apos;s in the room .
so what is the next step ?
the dna is an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another one thing happened , very interesting step , which is completely different , and that was actually started to interact with the information and to interact information so that communities have evolved from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria actually can actually replace their dna .
that &apos;s why the reason why is is growing too antibiotics .
some bacteria found out how they can stay down from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are contributing to skeletal , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
this communication would allow the reasons of communities that were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they &apos;ve got it together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community has succeeded , all the individuals of the community often repeat and the evolution of evolution .
the <unk> is where these communities are so close to the way that they decided to write the recipe for the community in a <unk> to the dna .
and the next thing about it took about another billion years ago .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> of <unk> , which are actually the act of the same organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asking on themselves alone .
your skin cells are <unk> without heart cells , muscle cells , and so on .
so these communities began to <unk> , so that the level of the evolution has been happening , not longer the individual cell , but the whole thing we call organism .
so the next step is happening within these communities .
the <unk> began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures which has nothing made of things else to process as information in the organism .
and this is the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have built these <unk> .
they started to train in specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and to the <unk> of information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point of an individual -- learning , now , within the span of the lifetime of life , is a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so an organism could not learn to eat some of a pathogenic , because she was bad and he was sick , the last time he ate her .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of one organism , whereas thousands of years , because this information has had to be <unk> by the individuals who died because of those <unk> haven &apos;t yet there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> process in this particular <unk> because evolution could be within an individual change .
it could be <unk> within a time .
what happened afterwards is that the individual organisms have been able to communicate with each other .
so , as example , the <unk> of us known version of this <unk> is human language .
it &apos;s a pretty intriguing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically , basically , <unk> notes from me , in the hope of this , in your head , which is a certain kind of resemblance to my original idea .
so we take a little bit complicated , it turns out to be a sequence of sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again again than a conscious organism .
and what we actually did , we have humanity , we &apos;ve started abstract .
we can go through the same stages that <unk> through the brain -- the abstraction of our methods that we &apos;re able to process data , is it .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on all of these are our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it all connects us to something that &apos;s much more and it &apos;s a much more and able to develop faster than we were .
now , we can have evolution in the period of microseconds in the time .
you also saw a little <unk> , where he &apos;s shown a little bit of a <unk> in the <unk> , right in front of your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again .
so the first step of the story i &apos;ve told you , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , just seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding itself and becomes , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- when something its <unk> increases .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here is in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feeds itself .
i live professionally , i live professionally , and i know that i know that the mechanism i use to build computers , not using computers , without the recently , we &apos;ve been done in the computer .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design for me , that in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking about is , we think on a certain <unk> , so we &apos;re going to make the machine that makes our ability to move far better and faster than we could ever do it .
and it &apos;s partly about ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
so , a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used in the last time , is evolution itself .
in this process , we put a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
so , to call an example , in the extreme cases , we can create a program which is made out of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , please have a hundred million randomly via instructions .
now , please all of these random elected instructions , and you can take all the things that i &apos;m going to choose the ones who are the next to the world . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to see numbers , that would be a simple example of which i used to do it .
so , find programs that can make the numbers .
of course , the chance of random officials is very small , that you have to have a number of random numbers , so don &apos;t actually the instructions will actually do this .
but one of those may be lucky two numbers in the right sequence .
now i say , &quot; computers , take a little bit now of the 10 percent of the sequence that i &apos;ve come to the next .
you get this down , the rest of the rest .
now , all of <unk> , the number of <unk> that have the number to be placed .
and it &apos;s a way of the <unk> , analogous to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they make kids through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids <unk> the features of the two programs of the <unk> of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came from distinct programs that have been something closer to the <unk> than others .
say , &quot; please , this process . &quot;
<unk> it again .
maybe give a few mutations .
and try and try and to do this whole thing with another generation .
all these generations need few milliseconds milliseconds
and so i can run through a evolution of a few years of years , and in more complicated cases , a few hours .
so , finally , i get programs to have the numbers on .
in fact , these programs are so much efficient than any program i could have to write by hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand it .
it &apos;s <unk> and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure that she &apos;s going to do the job because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because your life depended on whether they did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , he <unk> a card <unk> and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there &apos;s this airplane is made of <unk> <unk> , which together work to make their flight safer . &apos; &quot; don &apos;t make it ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal , if it becomes complicated .
so we start to rely on computer , for a process which is very different from the classical engineering engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow the normal methods .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so , <unk> <unk> is the technology .
we use these programs to make the computer so much faster , so that we can do that we can do that way faster .
so it &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s going faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of technologies are feeding themselves from themselves .
we have a <unk> .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog to the time , which is a <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> and we can &apos;t quite a bit of what we &apos;re actually going to be .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think that &apos;s something else .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we &apos;re the product of evolution .
and i think we all here here are part of the creation of the things that &apos;s going to be next .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear about it now , before i &apos;m going to be more <unk> .
my story starts in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the starry sky in the sky , and i was <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
we talked about nothing has changed since the ancient indian indian <unk> &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
when we were traveling to travel , we went to a car and <unk> about the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> <unk> thirst , he took a bow , fired into the floor and water .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it was afraid that i could lose the ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do without the <unk> and without tweet .
i found that technology should be possible to do and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology was going to be the most <unk> thing for me .
she was a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and to images in my mind .
i &apos;d like to take up as as we were holding our fancy clocks and cameras from them .
they were inspired by being inspired by us .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use them to use the magic as well as to kill the magic .
i started to illustrate books with 16 .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to do that the readers of the world .
it can be able to think that .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling is used more senses .
but what do we do with it ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box is ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a figure out in the book .
and again , a letter to me , and the ipad white from gps where i live -- that &apos;s really <unk> .
the kid in me is really excited about this possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean with a magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies actually found a glass of light , and i always found .
so you have to pour the ipad and the fireflies <unk> fireflies .
and the <unk> of the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that i was fascinated as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s a whole book , every world , and every world is a little <unk> that i &apos;ll take you to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s serving for navigation to the rest of the book .
and you can also show yourself on other places .
i &apos;m going to go .
and it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we all have heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> webs thousands of years in <unk> springs , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story of children .
a story that were working with new issues , like the <unk> .
for the issue of <unk> , a big problem for the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their dorm , in their computers , without a go .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids in the natural world with your technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re going to look for a quest , and you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads images of the <unk> objects .
as a kid , i had collections of <unk> , rocks and mussels , crab .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go out to a picture of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can go online online .
a child in london is a <unk> picture , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually sampled .
there is a variety of possibilities that are the magic and technology with each other .
so , in the next book , we &apos;re using a interaction where you use the video of the ipads and through <unk> reality , a animation of <unk> that looks at a plant in a plant of the house .
on a place , they &apos;re catching up with a place with leaves the screen .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , it just blowing and the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural nature of technology comes closer and to be closer and technology and technology .
we use the energy energy .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , and the love of our childhood is through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons , or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with socially the social weakest in the <unk> and places where there &apos;s a lot of despair .
here at ted , to see , to see , and listen to how stimulated that is , has given me a lot of power .
in the short time , i got a clear one : ted has a identity .
you can tell things that have influence the world .
and sometimes , if something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and strength that it would not have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of one should be meaning , but the words of a chemist should be particularly meaningful .
as a doctor can do good , as a doctor can do it , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about power of identity .
and by the way , i didn &apos;t learn the way in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was being big in a family , a traditional <unk> household who was dominated by a <unk> &apos;s dominated , and this was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , a strong woman , she had a impact .
she had the last word in every single room .
she was also the place of many more differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as slaves .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped their view very strong .
my grandmother was intense , but she was also benign .
if i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and <unk> me .
she was so realized that i could barely breathe . then they got me .
one or two hours later , when i walked out , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you know , you know ? &quot;
and if i say , no , &quot; i said , <unk> me back . when i said , &quot; she would let me calm me .
she was something that was going to be in her close to her .
the only thing that was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins fell around everywhere .
i remember , i have to have eight or nine , that i got one morning and i went into the room room . all my cousins fell around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the <unk> and he started staring at me .
first of the first thing i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and she looked very seriously .
this was so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and i got to me over , and she took me to me , &quot; come on , <unk> . you and i have to talk .
i remember that it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
she took me out to the outside and he said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you need to promise you that you don &apos;t . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; aye . &quot;
and she sat me and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;m watching you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot;
i will never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you have to promise to just three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; as the first thing i &apos;m told you you &apos;re going to love to love . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom &apos;s my baby and you need to promise you to take care of them . &quot;
so , my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , as the next thing i &apos;m told you , you will always do the right thing , &quot; but if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise is is you never become a alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother and brought this <unk> beer with her sister and i went to the forest with us in the forest .
we just like how else &apos;s as well as usual .
then he took a sip <unk> and offered of my sister , and she took me , and then offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s just like . &quot; i don &apos;t want to be a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do we do , you &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re doing whatever we do .
i had what , your sister had a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . power just . &quot;
my brother started at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do you , because of entertainment because of entertainment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all her , they &apos;re in special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to be a little bit .
i should not do that .
this is probably to be public .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i <unk> , i never drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say it &apos;s identity , because identity is power .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us , they don &apos;t think of all .
we can get them to do things they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would say all your grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the prison school in prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these topics are the topics we need to care .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1965 people were 300,000 people in <unk> and prison .
today , 2.3 million .
the highest world of states have today the highest world &apos;s highest world .
seven million people are discharged on on <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
i think , in my opinion , we &apos;ve altered radically radically .
socially <unk> and black parts of rule rule of despair and hopelessness , because of those changes .
one of three male black black black black and 30 is in prison , in prison , in <unk> , and in <unk> , and with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities , over the country -- from los angeles , in the country -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black men either in prison , in prison , in <unk> , and they were discharged and with <unk> <unk> .
our system is not just been able to do with <unk> who have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also going to be by poverty .
we have a <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> that they treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , it affects the result .
anyway we seem to be happy with it .
one politics of fear and anger , they believe that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there is a few of <unk> things there .
my home home , in alabama , they constantly threatening to be a <unk> .
here , and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently losing their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the <unk> of the civic <unk> of the civic <unk> is so high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
a lot of my client are very young .
the only country of america is the only country in the world , the <unk> children to die in prison .
in this our country , it &apos;s been <unk> for children with no form of their own country .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we believe because it &apos;s taught us that the real question is : has a person to die for a person of him ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : anybody &apos;s earned for a crimes of death , but we have it to kill it ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america defined by error .
in nine people that we were executed , one of the most innocent <unk> , the <unk> and out of death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never fly someone with a plane when nine planes , the face , one crash .
but somehow we can do it , from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking about these questions .
i talk about race and the question we &apos;re going to kill the right .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking to my students &apos; father &apos;s african . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time versus the end of the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the men in this country was a time of terror .
in many areas , people were afraid of <unk> .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror , which shaped her life .
so these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking about , they say , that we &apos;re saying to be the first time in the history of terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- say , &quot; say , you &apos;re going to grow up with it .
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> surrender and <unk> .
and yet , there are a dynamic in our country , we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what we have in historical context .
we get together on each other .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not too much not to overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , it was these willingness to be these willingness , but not in this our country .
i &apos;ve been given some talks in germany to be a death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up to and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear them so . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death sentence .
and of course , it can never be more . &quot;
it was silence . then a woman said , &quot; with our story is impossible that we ever want to do again for the systematic killing people .
it would be <unk> from us , consciously and <unk> people . &quot;
i thought about it .
and as it would feel like , in a world where german state people have <unk> , especially when there were many jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the u.s. of the old <unk> , we &apos;re pushing people -- here &apos;s the risk of being charged to death , 11 times higher , in their earth , the body <unk> people resting resting .
and yet , there is this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things also are also concerned .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but then finally , these realities of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite .
because we &apos;re going to tell that we need more hope , more engagement , more engagement , to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , to think of time , to think and talk about the poor , the <unk> , who will never be at ted .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own life .
we all have to believe things about the end of the day we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so much as we appreciate the intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our heart .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i believe that you &apos;re not just open to be open for all the light and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , has said .
&quot; when we fought europe against the regime , we wanted to all sorts of things , but what we needed was a lot of hope , a mental compass , the willingness to be , and the willingness to be in vain , and being found . &quot;
this mental orientation is the heart of what i think is that the <unk> has to have to get into this .
there is no evidence of technology and design that allows us to be able to be able to be human , as long as we can &apos;t look around and ears , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is much more than we think about it when we didn &apos;t care about it .
she will be deeply touch .
as a young lawyer i <unk> the great privilege of <unk> to meet the <unk> parks .
and back , back , back to <unk> , where they were told these older women , <unk> <unk> , who had <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who had been established -- a tremendous <unk> -- a <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were meeting and talked about .
and then , i called <unk> and say , &quot; <unk> , <unk> parks coming into the city . we want to talk .
would you want to listen to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very , very . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just just to me .
it was so inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i sat there and i heard this women , and after a few hours , he turned to me to me , and he turned to me , &quot; well , let me tell me what the initiative is to be in the same right .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to explain to injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were innocent .
we want to be the bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without having to eliminate their own children &apos;s <unk> .
we want to do something against death .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to eliminate <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then , he would put in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to ask ways to ask these challenges : these problems , that suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity is , from our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for anyone on the planet .
when somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t tell you , it &apos;s not just a burglar .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s how it &apos;s so , is it to respect the law that has to respect the law .
i think that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that there &apos;s the opposite of poverty of poverty is .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so exhilarating , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not in the things that we &apos;re going to do not about our intellect and minds .
after the end of the society is not measured how they &apos;re their rich and powerful and privileged , but it &apos;s how they deal with the poor , the convicted , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us up .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story of the end .
sometimes i implore i too .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes , we have these ideas of us thinking , in very much ways .
i <unk> these kids who were convicted too much of <unk> .
i go to the <unk> and visit a client who may be 14 or 14 years old , and to be an adult trial .
then i ask myself : how could this happen ?
how can someone make someone into something that it isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
and one night i stayed for a long time and thought , my kindness if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should have a wish of you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think more and i started to work on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor young young boy as a client .
and i started with this bill . the headline was : &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black <unk> like a privileged to treat white , <unk> <unk> .
in my <unk> , i explained that <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
there was a crazy line of that country that there is nothing more <unk> that there is only misconduct .
the next morning i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was this crazy bill , or actually , he wrote .
and i didn &apos;t just have written to my dismay , but also sent to the court .
a few months left over and i had just forgotten everything .
and then , i decided , my god , i have to the court , and this crazy case .
i got to go into the car , and it was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard to be so painful .
and finally , i went out of my car , and i went to the top .
when i was a staircase at the court , because there was an elderly , black man , the day in the court .
and when he saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of it . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force .
it touched a very deep thing to me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i went on the <unk> .
once the judge looked at me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
increasingly people come in , just because they were angry .
that i wrote these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office office .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people were covered that we were angry , that we talked about skin skin , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw the day of my <unk> , i saw the afternoon and go .
he always saw through the window and could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on and down .
finally , this older man came with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and put it straight behind me , almost the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge was a pause .
and during the break , a <unk> , it was upset that the day was the day in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the elderly black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the elderly man stood up . he saw the <unk> , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say this young man , not you , don &apos;t give it out of your eyes .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far <unk> , but that the justice <unk> of the universe .
that we &apos;re not fully evolved as humans , unless we take human rights and <unk> care .
that our all survival is to survive with survival every single connected .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , creativity and creativity , compassion and justice .
and i &apos;m particularly , i want to tell you that &apos;s as well , just say , you don &apos;t just lose the target . don &apos;t give them .
you have seen this audience in this audience , this community , a very obvious wish , and to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> where it &apos;s about , actually a <unk> , something from the <unk> <unk> , which otherwise the politics of punishment flows .
here , in california , for example , you will a billion dollars for a year for a year for a death penalty year for a year .
and yet , the <unk> percent of all the <unk> is not with a <unk> .
<unk> percent of all the <unk> don &apos;t come in front of the <unk> .
here &apos;s the chance there to do something .
this is the <unk> process is going to suggest to invest in more <unk> and security .
i think there &apos;s possibilities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the <unk> of america is intensely decreased .
this fact is often going to be in a relationship with elevated <unk> .
what would you tell someone that believes ?
well , actually , the number of the <unk> is not very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> on drug .
so there &apos;s a dramatic number of numbers at prisoners .
we have <unk> ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we &apos;ve been doing <unk> <unk> , which is people always bring people forever , for a <unk> , for a <unk> , for the theft of theft , rather than you force them to be able to give the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a priesthood , not less .
and i think our current don &apos;t help anyone to help .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really put a string string .
they &apos;re a inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
a increased <unk> is a increased <unk> .
two : famine in somalia , were the police : o.c. spray .
four : <unk> <unk> . 13 <unk> .
so six : social <unk> , 15 : 65 dead .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . mass of mass destruction .
recession . gridlock . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis .
oh my god .
so , this is just a couple of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it would have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the last six years .
in fact , media is likely to show us the negative topics because our minds are just about these topics .
and there is a very good reason for it .
every second every day , our senses are much more information on than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , is the first stop , the first stop , the <unk> of the information that the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our <unk> system , our <unk> system .
weed , and <unk> all the information on looking for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer it to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , the demand is really true .
now , with all of our digital devices that we have seven days of all the same negative news , 24 hours on the day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s no wonder that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
it may be the reality .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made over the last century through a series of forces , so much that it will be possible for us to create a world of excess .
now , i don &apos;t say we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we already have .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at the problems at the very long term , but they finally move to .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century so we can have the development of development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> the world population .
child mortality has been reduced to have a tenth .
and it comes to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs have been diminished .
so , steve pinker have shown us that we &apos;re now in a very peaceful time of the life of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> rate is just up by 25 percent of 80 percent in the past 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we continue our expectations on the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve defined by poverty .
consider that a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , water , toilet , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , air conditioning and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the world , never have seen such a <unk> .
the foundation of many of these are creating technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my great friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that is going to work on information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> of 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s how the mobile phone is going to grow a million times less and less than a million times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it is -- in good like it &apos;s in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
so this is the result of faster computers , the faster computers .
it slows down for none of our big problems .
and , despite your logarithmic <unk> on the left side .
so the growth rate is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that all the .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk is called <unk> , sensors and networks , robots , robots , 3d , 3d , which allow the personal to our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> biology , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory by <unk> supercomputer watson at the risk of you .
that was great .
i &apos;ve got the newspapers and i was looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s <unk> human opponents . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial cleverness would be fed on an artificial cleverness .
so four years ago , i started in ray kurzweil , and i here at ted , a new university called singularity university .
we bring all these technologies to do with special focus on how this could be used to solve the great challenges of mankind .
and every year we ask the students , companies , companies and services , which can be in a decade that can affect life of billions of people .
think about that , that a group of students can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can have been able to have been able to do that in dozens of companies that we &apos;ve done .
when i think abundance , i don &apos;t mean , a life of luxury for every on the planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making a hundred goods of goods .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource of <unk> power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he was invited the king of <unk> for dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
the king of <unk> , though , was <unk> .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the <unk> of aluminum is made .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> is its <unk> , it doesn &apos;t matter as a purely of metal .
it &apos;s going to be connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed the technology and made it <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
so let &apos;s project this analogy to take into the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with <unk> more energy than we &apos;re going to use a year .
16 <unk> energy , all 88 <unk> <unk> on the surface of the land .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there is good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india , to reduce the cost of energy in india -- <unk> <unk> in comparison to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar is 50 percent in the last year .
last month that has published a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sun areas of solar energy in the sun , solar &apos;s six cents per capita consumption , compared to 15 cents a national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we will also have water on the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> 1990 , when it was saturn , when it was saturn , and then it turned back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue network . &quot;
because we live on a life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent of the saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting to be more than 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there are also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the <unk> , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission to share with you -- he gave me the <unk> , the <unk> , which is , and you may have heard the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can generate a thousand liters of clean water per day of different sources -- whether it &apos;s saltwater , polluted water , <unk> -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the president of coca-cola has just been <unk> to start a big <unk> with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything comes right , and i &apos;m very confident , then , instead of this technology is going to apply global global countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there is now .
and we &apos;ve seen this at mobile phones .
you know , my goodness , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just think that a mobile phone in the middle of kenya , a better <unk> in the middle of kenya , when president <unk> has 25 years ago .
and if you look at google on google , you have more access to knowledge and information when president clinton in front 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication , as no one would have ever imagined .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries of books to medical research -- now , are literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell cell .
and the best thing is that is probably what we &apos;re expected to do .
in the last month , i had the pleasure with the <unk> of the so-called &quot; $ 10 million <unk> x prize .
we ask teams around the world , all these technologies to connect together with a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to provide a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device sequenced a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , it &apos;s called the right now and prevents a pandemic from its outbreak .
but now , the biggest force that will lead us to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just passed the <unk> .
and just by the way , the largest <unk> is a population population against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition throughout the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people online online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> from two to five billion .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard before , are going to join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are you going to desire ?
and instead of the economic gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic sphere of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that will flow up in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier and they &apos;re going to be trained by the <unk> , and so that they &apos;re going to be able to use 3d and &quot; <unk> computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can be three billion growing up , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> of us ?
how it was with a sentence of new , never have a <unk> voices .
how do it be , the oppressed , wherever they &apos;re , to be a voice to make awareness awareness and make change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people ?
how would we solve it with <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams is that inspires by passion and focus , extraordinary things can create extraordinary things , things that are the great companies and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there is a program that some might have already known .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s foldit called .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
so the way we can do in the process of the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that these days the human pattern is better the proteins and the best supercomputer .
and when those people came and watched who &apos;s the best part of the world , this was not a <unk> , no <unk> , it was a woman in the day , and a woman who was when the assistant to the <unk> of the world was the best <unk> of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me incredible confidence in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to ask us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to scale with an exponential technology .
we have a <unk> passion .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do that what needs to do .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something against a <unk> of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s with a medical medical , and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , when i allow me to allow me to give up a piece of my own <unk> <unk> to this .
now , before i &apos;m going to talk to the actual theme of my presentation , let &apos;s start a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the <unk> near and moving us to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball full of love is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; is soon and turns around statistics and around the way to use a great baseball .
i &apos;m going to tell a statistic of the i hope that most of you have heard already .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat hit 300 .
that means that the players is safely for three .
that &apos;s called the ball of the <unk> , he &apos;s going to be , and he &apos;s going to be , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t get out of time and the sudan was safe .
three from 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> box ?
that &apos;s somebody in the rest of the rest of you is safely four .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> <unk> baseball &apos;s <unk> <unk> , during a <unk> season .
let &apos;s go back to my world in medicine , where i &apos;m going to feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less likely to talk about it .
imagine they have a <unk> and you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine they live in a certain area , and they have a loved people with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> to a <unk> whose <unk> <unk> at <unk> .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on a branch of a branch .
and she proposes a <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the <unk> of a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
thousand , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows that nobody should be a good surgeon or doctor or <unk> .
what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re in fact that we &apos;re locked in the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one is going to be thinking about the details of how to be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took to medical medical medical .
i was a compulsively <unk> student .
in high school , a <unk> <unk> said that brian <unk> would learn to a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters at the toronto of the toronto , <unk> general hospital , <unk> of here .
i memorized everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and <unk> every branch of an artery , which is the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the time i took more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was wearing <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical medical that i was , if i knew everything , and it was so much as possible as possible , that i could make immunity to the mistakes of mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman , until i met a woman .
i <unk> at a <unk> in a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman , i was brought to me in the <unk> of the hospital .
at that point , i was a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> service .
and it was my assignment to look at the <unk> <unk> council , to investigate the <unk> .
and the feedback to my <unk> .
i &apos;m actually <unk> in <unk> , and she was in <unk> .
and as i tune her to her , they made a <unk> noises .
and when i was <unk> her chest , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides that told me that she suffered under <unk> failure .
that &apos;s a state in the heart , instead of pumping the entire blood on , you find a part of the blood blood in the lung and filling it into the lung , so the <unk> .
and that wasn &apos;t a hard diagnosis to <unk> diagnosis .
i put them and i made the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills so that she &apos;s liquid .
and over a year and a half and two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt good good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> home .
i didn &apos;t take on the right , and did what i should have been to have been a call at my <unk> to him with him , so that he had a chance to do a own picture .
and he knew she was able to have additional information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with good .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the smartest doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility to take care that i was so able to deal with my patients without contact with him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent her home home , i &apos;d give a quiet voice in me who tried to say , &quot; goldman sachs , not a good idea .
in fact , it was so much at the way that i asked the nurse , which was going to take care of a woman , &quot; believe it all right ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , in <unk> style , &quot; i think it will go right . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and they brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , the evening , i had this <unk> sensation in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day , i would put my things down to the hospital and went to work to work to work to go home to go home with the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went through the <unk> on my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who saw her to be a woman , but another three words , and those three words , most of the most <unk> i know .
other doctors also fear this as well , but the <unk> is particularly because we &apos;re just going to see the patient &apos;s so fleeting .
three words : remember ?
&quot; remember the patient that they were in home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said you in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after that she came home after i sent her home after home , she collapsed , and the family would 911 , and the <unk> brought them back to the <unk> with a <unk> of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
they were very used to be used blue .
the <unk> of all the strands of all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them on the <unk> .
i was shocked and to the inner <unk> .
and i was through this rollercoaster because she came to the <unk> , and i hoped they were coming out .
and after two , three days , i realized she would never be able to be able to be able back again .
she had not suffered a <unk> officer .
your family gathered together .
and the next eight or nine days , they decided to go through the <unk> .
on the <unk> day , she <unk> her , you go -- ms. , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you &apos;re not to forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next few weeks i was i convinced and i learned about the blind shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of common shame you feel , because you &apos;re not talking about the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame you see if you &apos;re a secret to <unk> , and you &apos;re getting a <unk> and the best friend of being in the end , and you &apos;re a <unk> , you never make such a mistake .
if you make <unk> , and the mistake never make it again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the most unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one of the <unk> is .
it &apos;s the one that says , that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t at the reason of my <unk> , he was very <unk> .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the <unk> of the <unk> and safely that i wasn &apos;t sued .
but i asked these questions about this questions .
why did i didn &apos;t ask the <unk> ? why am i <unk> it home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why am i going to have to medicine ?
slowly it would be safe .
i started getting better .
and then , in a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i may tell me , i can feel better again .
and i was thinking about that if i was in the perfection of the effort , and never again , and i never have a mistake that the voice could be <unk> .
and she did it .
and i was working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had a service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of it and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and when he went out of the door , he showed up his <unk> .
two days later , i came up to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to be on a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had an potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google , but it &apos;s not infection , but it &apos;s not infection , but the top of the <unk> and the closed the closed .
and luckily , he died .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of pity and self-doubt , and i was <unk> and went back and went back to work until it again and again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve been a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of things about it , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that only had 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i sent them home , and there were no disabled in their treatment .
i thought he would have been <unk> .
i <unk> the x-ray of the kidneys . when it was no <unk> , my colleague at the lower right-hand and <unk> and called the <unk> .
the other was very strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> and asking my colleagues to inspect him .
and he did , and he did a <unk> in the right lower , and he called the <unk> .
in both cases , they were <unk> and they were fine .
both cases of <unk> on me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was just in the first five years of what many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
some of my favorite media happened happened in the last five years .
alone , humbled and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m going to be a little voice that i &apos;m going to find , what really happened is , how can i do it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t make the same ?
if i got into a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you tell you the last time of <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh , you &apos;re going to be a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and to ask her immediate support , and we started telling you what i &apos;m just about , i would not do that , i &apos;m really sure someone would be going to change and keep the rest .
and in fact , if i knew , i know that a <unk> in my hospital would be told someone that would be made the wrong leg , then you think i &apos;d have to look at the eyes .
that &apos;s the system in which we live .
it &apos;s a completely asymmetrical <unk> .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make , and the ones that are <unk> , and without the restriction , and the <unk> results , and the very good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction as antibodies that attack one person .
and there is the idea that if we make the mistakes that make mistakes in medicine that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems with this .
in my about 20 years of medicine , journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical mistakes and wrong treatments , to just create the <unk> of my first article , which i was in the toronto of my first show , &quot; white <unk> , black way , writing .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we work in a system where a <unk> mistake is either a false or wrong , where the <unk> is always and more and more and more and more and dead or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians <unk> <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the institute of 100,000 .
they &apos;re very strong <unk> because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> , which is all two to three years , we cannot keep up to the .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , and i do it <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and i &apos;m a slightly <unk> breath and suddenly the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of those are error is unavoidable .
so if you take the system as i was taught , and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , then , then , the end of no longer left .
and you know the <unk> of people who are not going to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black way , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to anyone from the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; and then i &apos;ll show the microphone with him .
and then your <unk> turns , they &apos;re going to hit the head , then look down and swallow and start to tell your stories .
they want to tell your stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you &apos;re able to get in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new defined man is a human , white to be , is not proud to make mistakes , but it &apos;s all of you to learn from them to learn so that it &apos;s been on .
they share their experience with others .
they supported if others talk about their mistakes .
and they &apos;re making other mistakes that they &apos;re not about <unk> , but in a <unk> , supporting ways that everybody benefit from them .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes people in the system , and if that &apos;s like , then people can &apos;t make mistakes from time .
so the system is evolved to develop real-time societies that makes it easier to make mistakes , the people inevitably inevitably , and also allowed to do , and also allowed to create a lot of things that everybody who should be offered and to the <unk> of those who should be offered .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the new defined doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to learn to communicate it .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding by me , but it can live with .
so let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea of a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you about three stories about the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was <unk> here .
you may think that he <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he was taking fish .
he described one of them as a very common . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
until the &apos; 80s , he was actually marinated in great style .
now he &apos;s on the red list of the <unk> species .
this story is , many times of the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they were originally .
the <unk> is still described it as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to be another concept , the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s a point of <unk> .
because i &apos;ve seen it as i was in 1971 in 1971 in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> and i believe that i wasn &apos;t really out there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon was <unk> and a few trees .
there were <unk> from about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen were good and they were doing better for it better .
when i got to return , and i returned to the fish that was moved on half of its size .
it &apos;s five inches .
they were having been genetically <unk> .
it was still fish .
people still were happy .
and the fish that was lucky to be there .
so it &apos;s not changed , and yet everything changed .
my third story is about my favorite <unk> at the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- the first of the 60s -- <unk> europe has a lot of <unk> .
<unk> countries , who started out of 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this was this pretty ugly ship called <unk> .
i was driving on it , and we were traveling around the whole southern <unk> sea and especially in the <unk> sea .
we didn &apos;t have a words for what we started .
i know now it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected with the bottom .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots on the rubble there , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically , the ocean was the bottom of the ocean and then <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you &apos;ve been a census of the <unk> , and then with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changing . -- in this case -- a hard reason , or expensive corals will be <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , you threw them out because they were dead .
and once we started one alive .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
they then wanted them to kill them because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain of rubble is accumulated to <unk> every time , if they &apos;re going to go into areas that never been in .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our <unk> of the new level and don &apos;t really tell us what was there .
if you <unk> it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , some of good things are , biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of your country , the <unk> .
with time it changes . it changes because for people , they &apos;re all of of course .
every generation of the images that they &apos;re looking at the beginning of your conscious life , they &apos;re the standard and it &apos;s going to derive all of it .
the difference is then as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the temporary remains .
that &apos;s what is really , our goal now .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are not like they were .
you might think that the problem is the problem in the most of the world , they were killing animals , and they were just going to be aware of a few generations of what they did .
because obviously , an animal is actually there that very often , only even , before it &apos;s <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have a lot of animal animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a great loss .
with the time we focus on the big animals and the sea is the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re catching them .
and with the time , there &apos;s little fish left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
now , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , are telling , it was really different .
they &apos;re going to tell it because the evidence , as you &apos;re in a earlier form of these , not as you &apos;d like to the evidence to be arguing about .
there is an anecdote that the report of a <unk> report that was observing in this area of great <unk> , not being used , or don &apos;t usually <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in vain , because they don &apos;t trust the landscapes of the past .
and that &apos;s the enormously big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine marine , we actually basically come back again .
we can &apos;t understand the past , which cannot understand how the <unk> is changing and very low .
so , with people who see a marine reserve and the view of the individual is to have to have to have their <unk> .
what about the people who cannot do that is because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle of the west ?
here , i think the art and the film may be fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> , they may remind you &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think of the people who were touched in the way -- except by the <unk> , why were they touched so on the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s been lost in a way .
so my recommendation is , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is cameron , so that he &apos;s going to turn out the avatar .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist <unk> , you had to be a typewriter , this at the government .
they also had to register a leaf with <unk> from this disk .
the reason that is : the government could track where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , and they were able to track the creators of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand the west , as anyone could do that , and how did it really the speech speech .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
but if you take a new <unk> of the leading <unk> and print a page , this page , light <unk> on each side of the <unk> , in a pattern that makes the page clearly in and <unk> .
that &apos;s what happens to us .
and that doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and that was an example of how our own governments do the technology to us , the technology , the citizens .
and that &apos;s one of the three <unk> of the today <unk> .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can split attacks into the category .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> in ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several cases cases of <unk> , <unk> , which have been made by attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people have come online online , but they &apos;ve been illegal to them by using them , they &apos;ve been used to attract money from our <unk> , and we also do our <unk> , or <unk> , which we &apos;re going to take over a <unk> computer online .
the u.s. intelligence <unk> <unk> two months ago the swiss ledger <unk> <unk> <unk> , and in this account , <unk> million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is to <unk> itself , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m hoping that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to become victims of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse worse .
in the future , most of the crime is going online online .
the second largest <unk> that we can observe today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , a opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last ages of 12 months , and they have become a <unk> of the <unk> in the field of the <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : the <unk> who do it for money for the money , <unk> how anonymous that are the only group of nations , the most of the nations , governments who are <unk> .
there &apos;s cases of the time of <unk> .
it &apos;s a powerful model of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or , or it was that .
in the last season , it had been hit by the last season , because <unk> was hacked .
someone was hacked , and had been hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior colleagues , whether he &apos;s possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be done by the <unk> people .
and his answer was &quot; yes .
now , how are people dying in a row of these cheap ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a block needs , if you have a website with <unk> , with a <unk> service , for example .
now we &apos;re going to use all , or many of us , gmail , an <unk> , but these services are especially distributed in the states like iran , where the iran are particularly prevalent in the states like iran , where to use the local government , as they know that they &apos;re not <unk> in their conversation .
but can you , but if you &apos;re in a foreign .
<unk> <unk> and counterfeit <unk> on my .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
how does it be the following the spring spring and the things that are happening for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the fda argued in april of the headquarters headquarters the egyptian <unk> , and in which they found a lot of animal .
in this beast , a called &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot;
and in this folder , the notes in germany , one in germany , egyptian government sold a few programs with them -- in very large frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they sold this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments provide governments to <unk> governments to do with their own citizens to their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , we called the <unk> of the so-called <unk> , which was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to become a <unk> <unk> , then they &apos;re pretty much security to <unk> your phone .
but today we are far beyond .
you tap into your internet connection .
they use the tools like the <unk> to <unk> your computer with a <unk> , who allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer of people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t seem to be a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes no sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not to debate debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like , is every right , we &apos;re going to be out of it for always .
and we trust , trust , we blind one every single government , a government that we might have been going to have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a simple idea : <unk> <unk> from cement , the fit .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us in the able to build things that we were , building , building , <unk> , a rock after another .
essentially , the <unk> was become a building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , they got lego about this .
it was called <unk> stone . &quot;
and within less years , they got to a <unk> in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones , or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego has basically the <unk> , the building block of the world , and we made a block of our imagination .
in the meanwhile , the bell labs , the president labs , the next building , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that would us a world of static , <unk> building building building in the world .
like the <unk> , we allow us to build much larger , more complex loops , a pebble after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i mean that not that the building block of our time for experts is , and therefore i decided to change that .
so eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea how to do this idea how to put the things in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago i started to develop a <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic <unk> , which have specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , <unk> and sensor .
and the best thing about it is they connect with magnets together .
so you can &apos;t sit around you wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is <unk> .
so all you need to do is a blue and a green one of them , and they can build a very quickly larger <unk> .
they put a blue blue on a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switches into them , and they created a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> , which is , put it down here , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
put this <unk> for a extra effect , and they made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and the simple thing is , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of being coding , you have to program , <unk> or <unk> , allow you to program , intuitive gestures .
so to slow it up , or slow , it just turn on this button and it makes the momentum faster , or slow .
the idea behind the <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring any individual interaction on the world in a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , engines -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> and look at children and playing them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is , how you start to understand the electronics that surrounds them in the everyday world , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , like a <unk> , or why the doors to the <unk> of the <unk> , or how an ipod respond to touch .
we also have <unk> too <unk> .
so we had a designer of designers with no experience in electronic things that started to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water water water , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we took risd <unk> and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just card , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> from dough that fear has been in the darkness .
for this <unk> , <unk> , was another material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so , the open source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> download and make it yourself .
we want to the world of creators , the inventor , the creators , the world &apos;s <unk> , because the world we live in our lives , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and catching them up .
thank you .
