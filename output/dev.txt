they were in in sync with in sync , but then they were apart .
so i &apos;d like to show you first of a couple of interviews with people who were opening up to the site and describe what happened .

that &apos;s my grandfather .
and it &apos;s a simple reason that nobody is talking about it .
as the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning , <unk> <unk> from water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a <unk> of &quot; nature , which is the <unk> of the phosphorus crisis .
80 percent of them are just like mentioned .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology and one that &apos;s using <unk> technology to <unk> some of the <unk> , which we &apos;re going to the <unk> of the world .
and he was a called <unk> , and he was looking at all the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , rather than looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual stages repeat , but they repeat it without being <unk> .
as an architect , i think about relationships between the parts and all the things , but in terms of the design , it will always be a matter of business .
we <unk> ourselves on the level of the <unk> of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be in the <unk> floor to a single mass mass of them .
we come back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we will see that this landscape is actually actually known to look like the <unk> .
the difference is especially in <unk> in the desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever they want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal and now in the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and the <unk> in the world , just by fertilizers , the huge problems with water water ; rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important <unk> for <unk> .
but we can do that , and there are opportunities to do it .
irrigation is the largest <unk> on the <unk> .
work .
so , what is that system is system d. ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
all the system d doesn &apos;t pay taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological amplifier to reinforce this <unk> .
so this is what it looks like .
here we <unk> , or cut the nerve off , and <unk> the nerve and other parts of the <unk> and then left other pristine , that gave us our <unk> -- signal , two different , that we could give us a hand -- signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode in there and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- to have a clinically clinically <unk> to the .
this is jesse and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
african transformation has been defined with this condition , there there are 22 million people living with hiv lives , which is valued 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
governments , the place to have to create an effective health plan for ethical in clinical trials that are authorized in the different developing world . <unk> <unk> , which is established by the government and the <unk> of the study .
the fundamental problems we &apos;re facing is is to high consumption and too many people .
so they all fit the criteria that they usually have .
so you can see this power that goes to north -- the <unk> in this case -- which is enough to the galapagos , and this <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
we also know that not only threatens is threatened , but the magellanic magellanic penguins and other <unk> .
i want to show you that penguins are drawn in <unk> .
turbo himself <unk> , with his <unk> to the door door , and we &apos;ll bring it in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes to be comfortable with <unk> .
now , here is a fundamental problem that we &apos;ve not solved : our basic geography .
they &apos;re a pretty long limit .
again , like mongolia , china has no <unk> , it <unk> it .
for <unk> countries , china reduces its <unk> , so that <unk> and cambodia were cheaper to sell their troops and sell from <unk> to china .
so what i want to imagine here is i call a <unk> , day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with gaza .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? what is the future of european union ?
53 countries , and in the way , most of the suspects are the straight lines on the map .
that dream is ancient .
does it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone encodes that growth .
so how can a hormone eventually reduce the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and defined hormones are , in particular , in particular , in the circumstances -- in good times -- if food is there , and not a lot of stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on life expectancy .
and basically , you can modify genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process that i &apos;ve talked about , which is actually going on a very quickly , a different normal <unk> , like a bird , so that the bird can live .
you will never see an ad such an ad , because nike wants you to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes , the <unk> were .
it &apos;s like trying to walk on a <unk> .
this is what this is an idea that many <unk> <unk> <unk> , like prozac , how prozac in the principle of the brain as if it did the brain of a chemical soup .
and my <unk> year-old seymour said that too .
and by the <unk> , we found that a mutant , a lot longer took to go back to the <unk> , and when we <unk> the genes that actually mutation in this mutation were able to discover a <unk> .
this question has been asked for a long time to do , but we can actually test it .
so , mosquitoes find us in the dark , by making us <unk> . they smell .
just to you see it , this is cheese .
and people actually told me that they &apos;d like to be bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
and every time i felt the <unk> look at the face of the eyes of <unk> prisoner .
and as <unk> , fat is one of the greatest sources for adult stem cells .
as we speak , we &apos;re talking about radical clinical trials for the study of using stem cells for <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this in the world , not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if what does not happen ?
but here you see , what really is .
i can &apos;t talk about it , because i left out the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about the marriage of wisdom .
but how ?
it &apos;s better . it seems to be able to build these receivers with using material that it &apos;s coded in dna .
the animal jumps is , it &apos;s going to be expanding its wings , it &apos;s <unk> that , but it can &apos;t really fly , because the fly is trapped between two <unk> .
for a intelligent nature like our fly , they don &apos;t set in stone , but changing the animal learning through experience .
so many of these experiments , we were able to be able to be able to the identity of the critic &apos;s identity to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the <unk> and artificial intelligence , how to do that , but we still have not an only example solved , how intelligent behavior from the physical correlates in living matter .
so here &apos;s libby , or actually , a <unk> of libby .
ed : okay . so , you know , a little bit , please , a little bit more to go .
so i know , in my own experience , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite <unk> from legacy .
one of me , i &apos;m telling you , this kind of <unk> that is all about , from your goals , the <unk> transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health lives .
they don &apos;t stick like velcro , or glue , or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you remove the underside of the <unk> , and it would be a <unk> , or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so they did <unk> . and he &apos;s doing this .
of course , completely different than you would see that in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at increasing sea level .
and i would say that people are working in the oceans and think about the goals , we think they should be much lower .
that &apos;s the ship that i was in antarctica .
if this ice melts up its sea level around six feet .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news is the coral islands .
you have the relationship to the water .
but then at the end , they see the <unk> in black .
we have very interesting opportunity to this co2 co2 in the atmosphere of years , and we &apos;ve just done it with <unk> , but in this case we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked , to find out how gravity works .
einstein has already room and time and <unk> and parabolas that gravity .
but deep in the fabric of the room , the idea is , there could be more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a simulated different displays , which can vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical engineering that may be able to explain some of the <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we have two decks with colored dots on .
now , can see the predator , what &apos;s going to attack it ?
and what is true for sensory information is generally for all of information .
and we look at about 30 seconds , what is a pretty nice , in a 18 minutes of a minute .
why ? because if the dark is actually in the shadow , and the same amount of light would reflect on the eye on the <unk> , like the dark outside of the shadow , they would reflect more -- just to the laws of physics .
where do you know ?
and she comes into the beehive , you find a void , and it hands -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds it . madness , right ?
right ? yes ?
often , there &apos;s no right or wrong .
in new york , not so much in 2010 .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the risks , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern world complex world needs to be models to understand the many risks we faced with .
think about cancer , avian flu , swine <unk> .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there is another cognitive bias : i call it <unk> by taking data to the our <unk> and the data that we don &apos;t tolerate the data on our <unk> .
i call a different group of a different group to see if my airplane was safe to fly .
this is the people that people .
and he was found in the near , at stanford .
they had good deal with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took some people to get them to get them , or save me , i could find myself as a volunteer guy , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups were often immediately immediately out of terrorists . &quot;
they need a <unk> process , with the heart of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably probably to see the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution from the ground : a <unk> .
paradox is that the most <unk> decade was so <unk> .
so , in the time , the ngos were called the <unk> of their phrases , but they took them in negotiations , in the negotiations , because they were the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , this strange rich man in the film ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the the sun comes out , the sun comes out , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;ll admit that i &apos;m a little bit nervous because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we &apos;re going to think about cancer , that many people have been able to know about cancer than i &apos;m doing .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics , by just the genetic similarity .
and i like , &quot; okay . at least this guy &apos;s good connected . &quot;
so we &apos;re basically measuring every single way of your own .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some of the <unk> .
where we really have to have to get , is the process that &apos;s going on , and the level of the most <unk> activities on the level of the things that the body doesn &apos;t even heal , how it does it usually do ? &quot;
danny hillis : cancer , you know ,
they &apos;re all of tribes in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give up these people .
because on stage three , most of us are .
that &apos;s the lobby .
there was no plan . never have done this .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s <unk> sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair . &quot;
and suddenly they took the <unk> out and tried to find out , &quot; how do we ask the population of countries ? &quot;
automatically , we <unk> the little bits up to the top .
these are <unk> or <unk> <unk> , which was designed to make a lot of the control of the ground , on which they &apos;re not as a permanent building .
they <unk> the stability and safety , the lap of an uncle can offer , you compare them with the <unk> construction of a <unk> niece in high .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most sophisticated form of <unk> pleasure .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he &apos;s not .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical aid in a world that yearns after that , to bring compassion , the <unk> of the suffering that we could otherwise <unk> .
gandhi was a really <unk> man .
and the first day , our <unk> <unk> us , and we taught us our mission , which we had to be <unk> every day to bring the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of their known .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group without instinctively that the other way of the other people &apos;s minds .
so that &apos;s the world that we live today .
and so i &apos;m going to learn from my grandfather &apos;s mine in my own way .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine this , you &apos;re going to be a inner image : i was born in a very small village in mexico , in , unfortunately , very <unk> proportions , and my parents had no higher school schooling .
and so we think that by all the changes that are happening is that we face incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s an initiative that &apos;s been based on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we now sent 30 different technologists from 18 different countries , and we were able to connect to millions of people in the effort to have to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands .
and my father came to me and said again , &quot; you know , i remember , again , that every generation has to do better than the previous one .
i know many people who are very smart and yet , &quot; why can i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started them with a different family with the other .
don &apos;t you think that we have the responsibility to take care of goals ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to leave the same four years of old ford as before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he eats .
whether you believe it or not , it doesn &apos;t make any difference for me .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball is your identity , which you &apos;re .
when my kids were left , i &apos;d always go into her room , i sat on bed and i looked at my kids .
it &apos;s less than i had a <unk> -- i <unk> with three to 10 million -- but yet there &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , each one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10 books .
right , the famous chinese chinese demographic for <unk> .
and you answer the question : how does it feel like to discover ?
we really don &apos;t really really bad lesson really well .
think about a moment , how it &apos;s , is to feel right .
and other than all other animals are obsessed with trying to figure out it .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly <unk> book about a subject that everybody hate for a audience that would never be .
now , of course , of course , not just <unk> wheat wheat , but mountains of the grains .
in 1986 , they came from vietnam to america .
the answer was <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank on a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom <unk> has tripled our <unk> .
and bhutan , for the ones that it doesn &apos;t know is the recent world of the world , two years old .
it &apos;s actually like that we &apos;re often on the west often , as well as the happiness we have to capture , a thing , or maybe some things we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn is that we can actually affect the production of manufacturing , by using the right conditions so our employees can live their appeal .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
and under the deck , you &apos;ll tell you , you move , but the eyes move in unison with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , come from ?
the way : what did you do ? the outcome : what did you observe ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should be a voice and empower them to enable this also , so , so , is to a amy &apos;s last word in this short history .
poor people have no choice option .
we were <unk> in the &apos; 70s .
and around there , we have to realize that the principle of not simply harming the species we talked about , but also our society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody who has already been asking : &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how am i going to be up there ?
i was a professor at the <unk> davis system , and i got a lot of attention to this . that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart , and they end here .
i mean , people wonder if mobile phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> mobile phone .
and for those who cannot read it : it says , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green , green <unk> , which is not <unk> , is a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the most of poisons in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is called <unk> death . &quot;
it &apos;s just months later , i was sure who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; well , hold it alive if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we &apos;ve been defined the hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows that he was defeated .
and to give you this to allow you to go back to the wheel .
we <unk> the field , we <unk> it , we <unk> them in , we <unk> the building from the inside , the <unk> . we helped the first <unk> , and looking at the first time .
if i do this , i don &apos;t do it , i don &apos;t know the original details of the opposite , i could write a story here .
you will be withheld from the public opinion .
that &apos;s not particularly good .
and that &apos;s a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : which country &apos;s average better than china or india ?
because the indian man has a benefit from two years to the indian woman .
what change change is they introduced <unk> .
so , in china , i think , has always been some true , <unk> <unk> -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that there are no sense of india .
it was a place where people with <unk> and with various <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and now , you have the problem that they &apos;ve spent all the money to do with help , with this <unk> electronics in these countries , and now it &apos;s all <unk> .
one thing , really , the whole thing , where people have come from ideas , where people are more interesting , interesting , <unk> controversies -- people of different backgrounds .
about a decade , a wonderful <unk> named named <unk> <unk> , and read darwin &apos;s notebook from that period .
she <unk> himself with their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it .
does that the other way around ?
in the 1970s , it was a percent of the 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be in , roughly , in the category of capitalism , &quot; political changes that a group of good connected to develop <unk> , but actually , in fact nothing good for the rest of us .
while you can easily see how globalization and technological revolution , this global rule of money is much more difficult to grasp it .
so they &apos;re investing for unprecedented amounts of time and resources to train their children .
we created the modern <unk> .
that &apos;s his little hand .
we &apos;re all going to die at that .
this was a huge <unk> for us , because we were believed in a new development .
i think in places like oregon , where you can eat medical <unk> and eat a toxic dose , only half percent people ever done it .
so long , a long short , brief sense : they came to canada .
but i also heard of cancer as the most of the most important disease of our time , how does the good good and the bad ?
some of the paper actually went to be so far too far that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond that , not only against cancer , but it turns out that metastases in skeletal muscles .
16 percent ! that &apos;s because these <unk> tumors in skeletal muscle were , but only 16 percent of the matter of the shifts -- which is that skeletal muscles may be able to control angiogenesis , that these blood vessels for themselves .
it &apos;s a very far <unk> idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then my translator left me .
she was the girl who was in the breaks the other for her team .
and the same thing that i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia who had been a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what he said ? &quot; i asked the translator ?
so the two came in lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had kids from all of korea in korea , and he found families for her .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open the window , look out , look , and see , like flames of the side of the hotel hotels . the hotel burns .
so we took it into a bath , took them , and they took them and ate our faces and the kids .
until the adoption is through . a year ! what &apos;s so long ?
that &apos;s her <unk> .
this is sydney , which is three years in a few days .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are larger planets , there are big planets , ok .
but there is a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon of universal , or is it something that is dependent on the planet ?
and this deeper <unk> , which is the point is that science is the science of the life that we know it is to redefine .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , ok , from here .
thank you very much .
look : in the 1970s , in uganda , in the zimbabwe , chihuahua , russia was a percent .
they find the highest hiv in the world in the world in african countries , and yet they find senegal , down here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya .
it could be something else that is the transmission of common .
we know that about <unk> billion people ever lived .
that wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter period of time than it was in germany .
it &apos;s the same way with institutions .
they just have to give me to eat . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end with three questions about the future billion , in a nutshell , by 2016 , when the united states is to lose their place as a number one of china .
no , we &apos;re probably going to be able to be able to get the huge amount of <unk> that we have one , regardless of the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical <unk> .
niall , thank you .
there are many types of silk silks .
silk silk is almost completely out of the protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider , it &apos;s pretty diverse .
also , a great potential for the very high potential for its ability to <unk> .
what i don &apos;t want to pay attention is not the <unk> , so lovely to be , but i &apos;m on the photos .
you have to have physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographer .
this sound of alien to our ears , but what &apos;s going on is that 80 percent of the <unk> has contributed to the <unk> .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem , that the first goal of the institution is to the <unk> forever , and it &apos;s <unk> .
the creators don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who are trying to find out whether they &apos;re like a journalist or not .
it &apos;s been created by using their <unk> , who &apos;s use of many of these tools , analyzed , no doubt , the the agencies of the world today has the same work for attacks in the last week .
you &apos;ve got <unk> , which is probably the most part of bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just filled with fibers , because <unk> is made of fibers .
everything is in its space .
we call it <unk> .
but let &apos;s take a different steps back , under a deep level , and my search is to be a look at the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special in bread ? &quot;
that &apos;s transformation , two different things .
and when they &apos;re shaped , they go back to prove to prove that they &apos;re alive and character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of spent in every beer .
it will become a kind of <unk> , as we work through this talk .
it takes very long , very long , these scores , and i work on a piece , the <unk> of the <unk> , and that &apos;s a great part of my life and i &apos;m going to give myself the hair .
it &apos;s been able to write by brian <unk> , who is an extraordinary artist .
so you can give you a little <unk> of the inch .
so what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my graduate students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with eating -- a bowl with <unk> broccoli , and a bowl with <unk> <unk> .
i mean , the last thing , when we look at babies look at babies , they seem pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the <unk> is taking you to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness is incredibly bright and vivid , and everything is how dark .
&quot; babies and young kids are like the research and <unk> of human species , &quot; the <unk> alison <unk> -- their research explores how babies are in playing , and make some of play , potentially , potentially information and make decisions .
now , if i could just rent for a little bit for a little bit for a little bit of the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
and then you repeat this process and over again , until something more <unk> out , until the way that figure is to figure out the figure , like i &apos;m walking straight .
what we really wanted to do was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes of simple scenes like he would have .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it yet .
some studios use our software to do exactly what we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to see some of us in a few big <unk> in a few big <unk> .
we thought he would just be just balance .
here &apos;s how you &apos;re learning to go to the <unk> -- the most of you hope you know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times of 48 times , and then you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;ve been out today is covering frustration .
some stories are just classic , and yet it gets so understandable .
it <unk> . nobody has ever bought .
there is a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new empty document in word -- that might be .
but i believe it is actually two <unk> .
the other products that has been supported by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> , if i &apos;d someone write a <unk> , what happens every day -- i say , &quot; i forget me . &quot;
but as i looked at the most technologies technologies , nanotechnology , and others in the process of the digital technologies , i was very worried about the <unk> .
and to cut the risks of this new things , we ultimately need to limit the ability to have the ability to <unk> the ability to <unk> the access to the <unk> .
i think the challenge we are , i &apos;m sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is : will we develop this <unk> of the background that we use from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , they have all kinds of incredible characteristics .
and to give you a sense of the last of little disruptive fund , it <unk> <unk> on 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s quite remarkable .
and if you put the concept of insurance to scale , you can have a much more sophisticated entity -- the existing market -- to deliver feedback .
so 12 years ago , i started fascinated with me , and i shifted my research in this direction .
wonderful and gloomy things .
there is ice below the surface .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of life .
it &apos;s so much energy for biology in this cave , that there is actually a huge number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have many traits that have been used by people and other organisms earlier than habitat .
whenever you &apos;re a goal , you have to contract some steps , and they &apos;re going to be taken in a way .
and this is how it &apos;s about archimedes , the great king mathematician .
<unk> were made out of this , and it suffered from tremendous <unk> .

i &apos;m going to talk about how to collect stories like you &apos;re doing , in something .
one of those projects is about a year and a half .
these are the images that automatically will be created .

this records were human <unk> .
by a <unk> process , which is otherwise a job for 40 people over three months , to a simple job for three people in 40 hours . all of those are wins .
we should stop seeing outside .

and so it &apos;s going to be , even though the universe is forever , and the ordinary matter and radiation turns out , always a certain amount of radiation , some of the <unk> fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give big fluctuations .
it &apos;s got down .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe that you accept and not question .
i had never been used a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to do something to all of those things out , like me , to say , to the poor and the poor who are fighting with their dreams .

and some of them are in any case to use it for butchering .
our very literal reaction to images , the expression of emotion in art , to beauty of music in the night sky , and his offspring as long as human race .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here as the computer that sees the environment , and because you can &apos;t see the vibration , we &apos;re actually going to see the driver , so he really can see what &apos;s going on .

and the normal astronomers were full of contempt .
because it can live in the way of life that live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to the life on a planet .
there was another object , this high <unk> of furniture with creatures and <unk> and naked , pretty <unk> things for a little kid .

so we called it water water water , so that &apos;s another example where everything in a room is going to happen in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas that are the <unk> , it &apos;s all deeply intertwined with each other .

let me give you an example : in turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very <unk> republic , we had recently , to be <unk> , which is the universities , to protect the universities .

first , instead of flying over the past , and i &apos;d forget about the time , the time was very much <unk> .
but it &apos;s less likely to stay .
and during my first year , i was going to do my business .
it &apos;s actually said that more energy needs to make a solar cell , as they &apos;re going to bring in their whole <unk> .
solar cells , <unk> and four hours long .
and it &apos;s also , they &apos;re under great pressures and they &apos;re therefore dangerous .
this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder here , the generator and all the <unk> in itself has , and this is the hot <unk> , the hot cylinder -- the <unk> of the top -- that part is hot , that &apos;s cold , and it &apos;s electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can &apos;t cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a <unk> to use this energy as fast as we do at the moment .
we bubbles it on and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab with the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i have to have a bad poems , and he never got the <unk> in the air , but he went to cuba .
so , from <unk> can make great things happen -- -- i think i &apos;m going to land a picture of times , which is going to land in my work .
i work for the new yorker and i &apos;m doing <unk> , and then the 9 / 11 and this was , was a <unk> end of the world as we knew .
then , &quot; let &apos;s clear to get sure , is <unk> with the tongue , but so that we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his <unk> were extinct extinct . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody all around his staircase <unk> all over his staircase , and basically -- you know , <unk> seem to be a subject .
and she &apos;s made by george <unk> , so i don &apos;t think i think it .
td : since my youngest childhood , and after that , many different dues to me , and when i was young , it always came like that my way was already <unk> .
that &apos;s beautiful , but we should also remind ourselves that a similar process should be on an inner level .
td : lakshmi : lakshmi has been working , even for my invitation , let alone because of everything else she has done so that , and i was sometimes quite tolerant , and i was in this whole week .
in these two examples we &apos;ve seen machines that have been learning in the simulation , and other other that it actually learned in reality .
when i say , &quot; we &quot; i mean , i &apos;m holding the advice for <unk> .
but nobody believes it will actually be very effective if there is a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the spending in the administration administration , is actually more linked with anthrax and the threat of <unk> .
we know that the virus is going to mutate . it &apos;s going to be a different virus .
but in the scientific community , there is a <unk> debate about what percentage of the <unk> between people through <unk> and coughing and the amount of the hands of the hands .
some of the poorest countries that most of us have been with h5n1 have been carrying camps with drugs that are already up .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot to do .
i &apos;m delighted to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have evolved tests -- as fast <unk> .
and in the self-help of people in humans were similar species of species also have no problem .
don &apos;t just pay attention to how much fun you have it , but also how the <unk> of completely changed the way to interact with a city like san francisco as san francisco .
please , please put it with me a <unk> .
i <unk> myself with a young juggler , and he <unk> a to sell to sell three clubs .
already since my childhood , i was working with <unk> and climbing , so , the case is done . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
manhattan is not to be an infinite .
so i don &apos;t want to <unk> , right here ?
i &apos;m staying in the middle .
she became one , i was headed to the triumph of the triumph .
because of the <unk> petals and branches it is very dark in the <unk> and very quiet .
i and my colleagues of <unk> are interested in the dynamics of the <unk> that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising with the media on the media ; we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then the students have come in our <unk> , and they have their own <unk> with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to learn the frog as a frog , which is a highly endangered <unk> in the states of washington , and oregon .
he said , &quot; look at what you hide in front of you . &quot;
so we see a rising demand for <unk> , and so that &apos;s why it &apos;s why it &apos;s why it &apos;s why it &apos;s why it &apos;s why it &apos;s why it &apos;s why .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and i learned two really important things about this day .
the deeper we go under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started to go on this way about 15 years ago .
and in <unk> , the air is in the <unk> , where it comes from the air .
each of these computer can do the whole system , so if two of them are there , there are 4,000 .
but it looks like , and this habitat is always on , over a lot of miles .
so sharks are not quite so dangerous , as most people are doing it .
when we found it , we didn &apos;t even even sure about what family he heard , so we called him <unk> &#91; after &#93; , because he looked like he came from one of his books .
the oxygen toxicity caused a <unk> and <unk> .
this means that every and every one of you here is at least a child who &apos;s suffering from a <unk> .
and his communication and social interactions , so that he could go to a normal school , and even a <unk> .
it &apos;s like the life that &apos;s like , if you &apos;re only in it , you can &apos;t go back .
i know you never heard of him . but you &apos;ll tell you this day , and one day you &apos;ll hear about him because he &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s been died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everybody .
we all of us , are what happens when a <unk> of hydrogen and helium so long as you &apos;re going to ask yourself about your origins of questions .
this <unk> evidence that life can exist in many different environments .
so you have to estimate the diversity and the incredible amount of life on this planet in the first step , to estimate itself in a touch with life elsewhere in all of all of it .
so it &apos;s going to be a bit of the importance of it , and we &apos;re going to expand it in the world by using it on 350 antennae so that it &apos;s sensitive and to cover the moore &apos;s law of increased power .
and then we &apos;d like to look for the <unk> of human <unk> .
many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to investigate the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a <unk> of time .
while she &apos;s using the ice , <unk> , they <unk> a extra pair of gloves in a oven so that they can put a new pair of them , if your <unk> <unk> and their finger , they &apos;re stiff their fingers .
i think that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
and our soldiers are really excited about how to turn to <unk> pipelines to <unk> if they &apos;re actually listed to service to <unk> american <unk> .
you can further further and more and efficiency has been to have to have a few more sophisticated improvement and so the viability margin of the big energy rate .
we could build bigger cars , which would be easy to do , but light should be .
but instead they &apos;re selling it to china and japan because we don &apos;t have <unk> to protect our <unk> and the other .
and by the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> is power to the <unk> production of this kind of materials , or in this case , to make <unk> <unk> , as good <unk> ; the <unk> can be able to do the same thing that the internet was out of the internet .
it can &apos;t be just a huge <unk> conspiracy to act .
there were two types of negative feedbacks that we have .
we hope it &apos;s really stable .
<unk> , i &apos;m wrong .
at the end , he found a <unk> , a dutch <unk> called van meegeren , who was a wonderful vermeer sold to a price that &apos;s about 10 million dollars .
according to his <unk> , &quot; he looked like he was first discovered that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it comes on . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find them , how much they move them sexually or romantic , is the key of what you think of you .
but each of those three objects has value beyond what it brings , because of its story .
but i don &apos;t want to see a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his <unk> to a <unk> truck in washington d.c. to see a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock hurts less , because you &apos;re used to be used to it .
and if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see that there may be a kind of political <unk> .
they <unk> it to that they &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which is very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is is that people who eat vegetables and oil , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> point , if you &apos;re having a drug in a high dose of them , that it will be more side effects , and that your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
that &apos;s a problem for that there is no solution to this .
and very soon they started , this coal <unk> , ton around <unk> , <unk> around <unk> , <unk> around <unk> , back to china , and all over the world .
can you imagine how you would feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that all of you know .
there &apos;s this thing , the <unk> of the world , and it &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they are christians .
man , americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all else are chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of you have to be bent down to his child and she said , &quot; darling , i &apos;m back afterwards .
everything has changed .
and all that has been huge implications to the world .
i think thomas jefferson actually got really very well in words .
for the <unk> in the audience , in fact , is actually explain why <unk> a larger budget than <unk> , and that &apos;s because they &apos;re getting more easier to <unk> in other languages and cultures . so , the market is bigger .
but it will happen within this century .
this is not the <unk> of the united states , which is going to be in about a million , but gdp of the world per capita -- fatalities of the world .
also , like everybody here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is a lifetime of a life that began to be a lot of obligation to grow the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> .
a lot of our actions on this planet that are living in our living environment , just by faith and <unk> .
one is a huge for thousands or millions of years .
we have to calm ourselves before we ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : the earth &apos;s life on earth
another <unk> is the famous european <unk> .
the passenger pigeon is contains 1.3 billion base pairs .
the reversal of de-extinction is falling in the category .
real falcon , of light <unk> chickens .
it &apos;s a program to <unk> , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional topic . some people have come up .
my grandmother was a housewife .
i also made my own comics , that was another way to tell stories , by words and through images .
and we sat in a minute , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . record , how you say it .
&quot; rather jarrett , i get your <unk> .
i &apos;m also going to put a children &apos;s children with the title , &quot; <unk> police <unk> : the <unk> who <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us constantly , psychologically , cognitively and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds of burgers , the very important <unk> , which was built in england , designed by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by this .
people who say , don &apos;t have the team next to this team because the noise may have and need the other silence .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary businessman who is in a suitcase with a suitcase and reality and reality and reality and reality and reality , and not in the situation , and it &apos;s not in the situation .
<unk> <unk> and four and four years and labor later , what began as a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> talented actors .
i know theater connects us together .
now the time we can apply the diversity of our talents to create a intelligent , important and extraordinary work . and just simply .
when you look at your bathroom , you see , you see a couple of products like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also toothpaste .
<unk> molecules -- or , since the &apos; 70s , <unk> whales -- it &apos;s used to be injecting in folding .
in total , i found <unk> products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i fear you have a long and <unk> year . &quot;
i said you to tell you , you should be <unk> , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they gave me feel somebody in a time , in a time i was like one of one .
they &apos;re working on january of january , so that &apos;s been in the 1930s , so it &apos;s now reached the letters .
hundreds of verbs can behave in the way .
you can see that as the language of thought , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why is <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are so often veiled ?
you can try to imagine what might be used as language just could be used .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what is that insight from that , to convince me ?
all those different rollers , can you imagine an argument where you &apos;re going to participate , but also in the audience , and you debate in debate ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most fundamental part for me : we want to be in the world of nature , and we &apos;re bringing a <unk> and find the masters of the adaptation that we could inspire us .
that changed everything . from there were these engineers to <unk> .
here &apos;s the opposite here -- here &apos;s the opposite of things .
this is the <unk> national laboratory .
this would be <unk> for fuel cells , if you could have a <unk> .
this is not easy , because life uses only a subset of the elements in the <unk> .
feel like that , feedback is very important .
what you can &apos;t see , you cannot count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .
in south korea , indonesia , almost a million companies are women .
because , as the <unk> is noticed , smaller <unk> in direct terms of economic economic growth .
and the in all world , they are not exceptions .
people <unk> whether this <unk> and this miracle .
i have a <unk> <unk> von <unk> , even <unk> cows on my <unk> , and i &apos;d like to use paper towel to <unk> .
we were <unk> it .
what does that mean ?
when i started to do with you , i realized they &apos;ve been incredibly well adapted .
but researchers had a problem .
and then they took their degree and the campus left -- and certainly happy were getting away there -- and some time later , and that crows still always happen to them .
we found that they really smart and they can teach each other things .
<unk> would come to go and go for the peanut , and again .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about , but even more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever be hiring ? &quot;
and imagine what happened , because every region has something .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the <unk> of the future . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot to <unk> .
oh , i &apos;m going to be the johnny &apos;s <unk> of the sound .
about 10 million <unk> .
and over here , we see , with the words of radiologists , israel , &quot; as the hand of the penis <unk> in a way that <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would rather than to eat if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had a line in his book that was called <unk> from the <unk> , there was a <unk> mary <unk> , who had trouble with conception .
so now , you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i think it &apos;s so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i would have it to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i would have thought to this moment that the age of 50 , one of the skills i really , was , my shoes .
first of all , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know how to <unk> the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while i decided to have a little bit of fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i got some things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
my father was one , my youth was so interesting .
the song is a mere fact .
i mean , &quot; wait , it &apos;s good , -- i &apos;m going to put wheels , &quot; from my hide , i got the <unk> wheels , and i built them and -- check . i could have my <unk> ?
it just sounds like , but i think we &apos;re in general in our society and culture with the <unk> of a <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> self , and he was really proud of it .
boy , i love this thing .
the consequences of the planet , on that already , seven billion people living on .
and so proud of his cushy , he was in the cushy seat he gave his <unk> to his <unk> , and the beautiful <unk> around the seat around the seats .
purpose -- a life with intent -- that &apos;s the original thing to do better .
i saw the green mass of a left , and i <unk> that she was lost , <unk> all of the things i hadn &apos;t done , but not more possible .
and then i started , as many times before , asking how my life would have been otherwise , if this man wouldn &apos;t have hurt me if my genes had a different way of experience .
i was , but i was , but i was , i was , i was , i suspect , i suspect , i &apos;m going to be myself .
i had simpler to trade and write this turkish <unk> to four words and to make me again .
he spent six months in prison , his <unk> for a decade .
yeah , contrast .
we work with the machine <unk> laboratory at the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people , and two , a natural interface , a natural form of the interactions , so that the interaction is going to be more intuitive by the robot .
and yet i made this idea too .
after i realized this economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution to this problem .
some of have even seen them in the tracks of the <unk> , like nathan <unk> way , or the one of tim ferriss who occasionally looked at as a choreographer .
i don &apos;t know any tedtalk that involves .
this time , i paid 25 cents because i thought the job was a little bit harder .
and yet , there was one , which was all safe : the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of dark energy in mind , because i &apos;m going to call three <unk> to string theory .
the <unk> came up to about 10 feet to about 10 .
and he was working on , and he was working on , this number , but he had no success , and we know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by putting it powerful telescopes in sky , a handful of photons photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , billions of years .
now , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it , and we want to really engage it and more interested in it .
he said , &quot; go , milo .
pm : this is dimitri &apos;s so right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know anybody .
so the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work , the television is coming from , the tv is <unk> , <unk> men on the road .
it was a very bleak meeting who had been working on the war , the employees of aid , and of course of the bold , brave people of sarajevo .
so if i &apos;m asking , why i &apos;m going to do more <unk> , why i &apos;m going to stay , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my job of this segment of this segment of <unk> , and this is the <unk> , the nub of the things , for us .
even before the goal appears that you can try to find the joystick <unk> <unk> <unk> to the target , wherever it &apos;s .
basically , we &apos;re basically using the animals that they learned to control these <unk> and to explore objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment we did several years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju was finished the <unk> .
please raise your hand .
the last reason to do with it , that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , one of seven women in the age of seven women at birth of a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he &apos;s <unk> the world bank bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investment in the world of girls are going to be the highest <unk> . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the <unk> bird .
this whole gyre of <unk> tell us that there is a <unk> .
and even this picture is the suspects of the suspects that would be the <unk> of being <unk> -- like something from the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> circus .
one of those options was that we could have put ourselves in little <unk> .
they put their arrowheads and say , &quot; i want to share these arrowheads &apos;s breaking over the way . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where you can all meet three or four miles into a new language .
if 27 individuals from this 27 member of these 27 member of these 27 member of us to put their <unk> , their 23 languages , then they just tell you a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , to be prepared for all the possibilities to be prepared for all the possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they had language .
and what most interested in most , is the invisible space between a text and the other image , and how the image is changing through the text and the text through the picture .
this is <unk> <unk> who are distributed over the atlantic ocean and north america with europe .
they &apos;re going to turn it negative .
but by the impression of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> served eight years of a <unk> loan off , in arizona , for kidnapping and <unk> <unk> of a <unk> boy on a <unk> .
in front of the people &apos;s left to themselves .
and they &apos;ve brought them to texas .
and now , you &apos;re driving with the time , where it &apos;s in that moment .
it &apos;s just the vastness of the space that makes it look like this , as it does not happen .
and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of hooked , and the pursuit of happiness and human design .
part is the legacy of <unk> , the <unk> , which is striving for happiness for <unk> purposes , it &apos;s going to be <unk> by <unk> aspects of the individual and cannot find out in the reality .
a <unk> in the science of happiness is that happiness and <unk> no <unk> in a closed-loop continuum .
it starts in the <unk> .
here &apos;s a three year-old baby .
there is only one way to increase the status in the kingdom of the kingdom , that &apos;s dominance .
i want to close with some quotations .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has understood it harder to make it harder to make it harder .
you can actually cure , but even people who are hiv-positive .
knowing that a patient who remains microscopic <unk> , to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be sure that we &apos;ve been saved .
here we see neurons .
so it &apos;s important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is : if i just watch another person , why am i not confused , and i literally see this <unk> of naked , as someone is touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i actually don &apos;t really do it about the <unk> , but to the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a <unk> , by the way in the lab of kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell us a story of us .
we have to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to tackle this crisis .
right at the 1980s , when we were talking about the women and death by heart disease , and then she wrote an editorial for the new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided to be , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , x-rays , <unk> , for women whose <unk> the <unk> for the heart of the <unk> , every time we &apos;re starting to approach , that &apos;s a little bit of radiation , we say , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they did what they said , they were having <unk> and have been campaigning .
the cells have something like <unk> ; in the dish , they don &apos;t feel about it .
what does that mean for us ?
in the run of three years , we took eight to 10 hours every day , and collected about a <unk> hours of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> , which came out in front of a year ago , that really surprised us .
and finally , my son alone is in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project , philip <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy are here .
and there is a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son made more than two steps , in the movie .
and that &apos;s a important to <unk> question . because the better we understand how the brain is important , the better we can communicate . i think we can start with all of us , we can think together and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to the right thing . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is , our teams <unk> all the entire <unk> on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just hygiene , but also to be the opportunity for recreational .
so , you don &apos;t build it .
if you translate that into the building industry , if you have a <unk> and a window is broken , then we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that needs to be fixed .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we went on .
are we just stupid ?
you can scan through through two years , if you read about eight hours a day .
so , you can see it in september <unk> , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why do you do not that , and why are you doing that ? &quot;
and the police waiting for the air fire to fly the vehicle into pieces to get the body of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to the present in the present of the united states , in the one of the divine <unk> of divinity .
all of this leads us to -- <unk> , just to name this , which is what we &apos;re most of doing digital devices .
so that &apos;s the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side by stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be discharged from the health care .
he then then he kept my jaw in the right position while he was my teeth on the right position .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator , who is fascinated in the feelings of consciousness , whether he &apos;s hearing hearing hearing , or a blind that , or a <unk> movement .
now i had to go out in the dark years that followed , what i stayed when everything that was special about today .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and that &apos;s on this side . a large <unk> of africa and the
and then deng xiaoping got money to china and brought the land back in a middle .
a search for us to transmit the data in a temporary format , and we can see the world , and what we hear when we look around us ?
but this is created hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained to life after it &apos;s been created , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned in francis crick .
but there were the ones in literature .
we were not the best chemists in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girls didn &apos;t get me .
you can basically compare dna dna and compare to <unk> segments .
and so i &apos;m going to close by saying that we &apos;ve seen 20 people with schizophrenia .
average , the defense costs in one case , two million dollars , and it takes 18 months when they win .
first , not the patent , not the patent , but against the <unk> .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to leave you with a <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; , the girls said .
the fathers were in a place where they &apos;re going to play their daughters to play their chairs and their hands could reach out to the dance .
that &apos;s a great technology .
it &apos;s not much left left left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
can &apos;t see the most of the time , and how to do it really needed another way to eradicate polio than we did with smallpox .
it helped have pandemic <unk> , sars , for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult to view of the view ?
bruce <unk> : how we &apos;re going to get polio for a standstill to a standstill .
dj : we found this <unk> in all sorts of animals , especially in the big .
and our surprise was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant is a symbol of inspiration in many ways , a symbol of that hope that we &apos;re accompanied with our work .
it was incredibly amazing as she took it in safety to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , when i look at this <unk> , the <unk> , it reminds me in a eerie way to a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in your hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as man and woman , as a community and part of this planet and we need to continue to continue on .
after all , it seems obvious to be that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun is small and flexible , but it &apos;s worth remembering what <unk> should be <unk> .
and that &apos;s because in middle middle of the ground is always there .
nature of this model is dependent on the way we &apos;re .
because there is so many of them , and because between them not no consensus in your favorite <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , as we see it in middle middle , <unk> and found .
people like to treat the <unk> of the things like scientifically , and it &apos;s a natural time of time , if you want to guess what the question is going to do next .
i was going to <unk> <unk> at the <unk> age of 40 years .
on a cursor , i &apos;m controlling with my head , i allow me to see video of the robot and send commands to send the pads in a <unk> .
with the help of people like you can do this dream .
so in oceanography , for example , a <unk> lexicon is designed by the <unk> , which is basically the <unk> that <unk> the dolphins .
i think together , we can create a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there are some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but usually we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is now at 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also assume that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what really is sad when you think that this is the most common language on the internet .
what are you looking at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should that be interested in me ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow it to be out and look out and find the world and find it in it .
they would overcome wealth and security , religious violence and make sure that states never even <unk> terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war , the 20 million people took life -- until today the <unk> civil war worldwide .
<unk> sen , who is this guy , &quot; i would have been made all of this money , but i &apos;ve spent all of those time to look for the american man who had stolen .
chinese restaurants have been done largely the same thing , i would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant -- and without centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which began in the fact in new york city in the early 1970s , as i was in the university of new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in january , the 18th century , the <unk> search is looking for medicine &apos;s <unk> , which creates the same thing .
so people would really have a big <unk> .
when the <unk> started to become less , i was always <unk> , i thought , to my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember , as a child &apos;s a way to get to a line ?
in 18 and 19 , i was walking around the night .
again , i &apos;m going to be a little depressed and i &apos;m <unk> .
and so many of us is clear that it is a lot to do a lot of the next few years .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where the world was working on the treatment of the known problems that were caused out of the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you make the impossible , you make it possible .
but we &apos;ve reached a deal to climate change .
and there was crying god .
the <unk> is something remarkable : it uses two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their circulation to create a material that is a <unk> , to do with technical fibers like kevlar .
or you &apos;re <unk> things like this , and you can catch that out of the camera .
here &apos;s how it &apos;s taken by tissue .
with my new project , marilyn <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there is also a little bit that the way that the <unk> and the round of applause and the <unk> -- hopefully no -- to help him to help some of the next choices .
what &apos;s i just do ? &quot;
in the frame unprecedented demonstration , heather knight data , a <unk> , which is far more than <unk> <unk> -- he collects the feedback of his audience and how to be the answers of the amount accordingly . it &apos;s the answer to the way ?
stanley prestero , inventor of known <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which is called <unk> and <unk> , that there &apos;s between two times a connection between only five to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships are about the whole <unk> groups ?
there was a <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he could have been able to put this bug in the ear .
&quot; my father , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided that they needed false papers .
this sense of the responsibility of others , he had the lives of others , and also his fault , a <unk> , because he was made out of a camp while his friends were left , he kept his whole life .
and while my <unk> and my <unk> had been given to be a orphans , sort of orphans , i made false papers .
i asked him , given the victims that he had to be able to do that .
we &apos;re growing up by a few million people on the seven billion people we &apos;re in .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> level , which is a <unk> after the next <unk> , which is a good state .
if you <unk> the forests , the border of the <unk> is <unk> , you &apos;re going to stay stable , stable to stay stable .
with the realization of <unk> , fishers , the great barrier reef <unk> and scientists , that the great barrier reef is <unk> under the current <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , that clear is that <unk> change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like the media .
this is a <unk> of a race from far developed .
first , it uses a ancient kind of manufacturing , which is <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology at that time .
and through the process of sugar on black <unk> , i made portraits of them .
it became very large images , and i took them with a very big camera on , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially in bad <unk> , is very far .
and then on the back , there is a sequence that we face in the chimpanzees .
we then can ask : there are general general differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of the living with the human genome .
we can then ask us the same question for the other , as a result , how they have the ancestors of today , do you mixed with numbers of today ?
there are many people who made their own vision of what we &apos;re from the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the plane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine , <unk> grow in the 3d printer , and they &apos;re embedded in a <unk> , and the effects of the forces that occur in their components .
they don &apos;t speak . but especially they were extraordinary isolated by the world around her , from their environment and by the people .
they would call <unk> . they would call the police .
now we now know that it &apos;s about 100 is about 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research that you &apos;re dealing with , really , really , you can actually prevent them experience with that i started my way to that area .
e , you raise .
<unk> you &apos;re in a rigid body room -- chin on the <unk> , arms extended via your <unk> .
they made everything exactly as we taught them .
and after the battle they bring these mobile games and do what you call &quot; <unk> , to teach you what you &apos;re wrong .
also people changed .
i asked , &quot; where is it right now ? &quot;
that &apos;s not a laundry .
and she showed up on the left to tell me how the problem was this picture that it was for her to the idea of the idea of how black represented were .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the <unk> that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m .
now , there &apos;s a obvious one .
and the kids said , &quot; how should we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to do .
so i said , &quot; how long did you deal with it , before you decided that you &apos;ve got no ? &quot;
their <unk> increased increased 50 , which is otherwise fine school in new delhi with a <unk> biotechnology .
76 percent . the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted presentations , he would be <unk> da vinci .
that &apos;s 10-year-old .
suddenly , i looked out of darkness , from darkness , on the <unk> side of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the moon on the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some snippets from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the tempest .
and our little life ends in a sleep .
bono : &quot; they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything was the blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of play in africa .
it &apos;s another one of the <unk> of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> <unk> , we have , and find out what price people pay for for the one that they would have the choice .
thank you .
the <unk> was : if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we were destroying two <unk> and 10 tv .
and the little <unk> to remove itself from its trace and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to be slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models that i work with .
and the tissue of <unk> densities is the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to be able to use these models for <unk> .
thank you .
and trying to fly at just how to fly an arrow to shoot an arrow to shoot the <unk> , and it was tough work , and boy , boy , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even <unk> developments , as <unk> -- with darpa , the california institute of the university of technology and the university of los angeles .
be careful how to make them like wood or so , like that .
now i didn &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they go on forever .
that &apos;s about two billion .
it takes for about &quot; three years of <unk> . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one of the same as you .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for time in which we live in the human mind and machines together .
i &apos;ve got a mass . where is it coming from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that could be extinct in the wild world in 20 to 30 years .
all evidence of evidence to suggest that this cancer is transmitted from a virus .
i took the opportunity to it , and took some samples from jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples from other parts of the parts .
she brought him to a vet and this discovered something <unk> .
and finally , cancer is a <unk> consequence of the ability to share itself and adapt their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would <unk> to wait for waiting .
and that &apos;s the third reason why not a low expectation of us not make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t think that the numbers are on them .
first of the first , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken if we &apos;re going to be aware of this <unk> .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century , asia is that gradually coming back to live more than half the world &apos;s population and over the half of global performance .
you could look at this as the privatization of the spectrum .
after 1958 , the soviets had sputnik <unk> , it was like , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or <unk> their view of china is something different than when they live in beijing .
and if we strategies that we &apos;re going to be able to do this in larger historical context , we will be able to do this process .
how we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> .
that &apos;s the conventional approach of the
this has typically the responsibility of the responsibility to guarantee a stable <unk> to guarantee a stable settlement .
they &apos;re on the long one .
and who ? especially for young men .
after the legal collapsed after all the legal collapsed , you can &apos;t get access .
the care of the way that &apos;s been going to be <unk> after conflict , government .
this is the full of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has realized . they call the climate change a <unk> , the security and stability as governments to have to be in the world as much as to react .
it allows you to become more productive so so that they can afford to the insurance at the time .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel able to do in the situation for a <unk> world .
listen like chinese students are screaming in english .
teacher : perfect ! student : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , with abstractions , which we &apos;re trying to make sense consistent , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , that we &apos;re going to be a better wonder than what &apos;s going to be .
luria , as people watched people before they went to the scientific age of <unk> , and he found that these people are resistant to a kind of foresee in the concrete world .
and there was luria , &quot; the north pole is always snow .
they chose for <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would you be to be killed ? &quot;
you could say , a <unk> circle .
it feels like i &apos;ve got to the colony of angels . &quot;
and they <unk> me to do a degree in something .
it &apos;s still in the red figures , but chris did it with a different sacrifices that film <unk> .
i &apos;m one of her <unk> .
there is a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : the <unk> is serious .
we all <unk> them , &quot; why do you do this ?
that &apos;s going to be much if you read it . &quot;
we were always played the game after school for weeks , about seven weeks , and we all have <unk> in the most of all of the 50 crises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good jobs and they were the <unk> .
it &apos;s like your own little connection .
if i all three legs of them , in the three <unk> of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so , all you &apos;re doing -- it &apos;s a very <unk> case -- this old <unk> and this old plastic , the old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; . this <unk> is very easy to be in an old <unk> .
that &apos;s possible when you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school , or a state of school -- a leaf , a a <unk> , no glue , no glue , no scissors .
what we do is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little straw you do , is these two corners here , it &apos;s like a <unk> .
here are two magnets .
it was a lot of passengers on the ship , and you got bored , so the captain invited you to be on his deck .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> gupta , and yet amazing plans to make waste in really <unk> , and turn to build , and turn to build the fundamental principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that held a lot of evidence .
and there are some examples of the projects that are aware of the way of the ecosystems .
and with a little bit of planning , we can control the place of transport , in an open space , the open space for people , and it &apos;s going to bring people back with food and waste into opportunities to be able to get together into opportunities .
this one is taken at the day of the day , and just a year later , it looked like this .
when you <unk> seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to go through the people &apos;s <unk> <unk> with the visions of the <unk> . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who was jewish because i was jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real thing was that there was a lot of men who wanted to come to me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with itself .
he &apos;d like to travel , as long as it is not a <unk> .
i was trying to be in principle how to be <unk> .
because they remember my <unk> : you have to achieve a <unk> of 700 points , and nobody did this .
most of them , <unk> are the average of 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the <unk> demographics , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the morning .
imagine your vision whose vision is very , very good .
these <unk> has even many other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also quite much better , is our ability to pursue objects in our environment .
so i want to ask you to get this conclusion , and it &apos;s in the context of another group of <unk> , a group that actually looked at in our society that are out of people who are in the high high .
let me step forward to this step with a task that &apos;s called mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just let all kinds of things in particular case we &apos;re looking at .
so it was a big , very complex project , which i don &apos;t even know if it works at all .
so , wolfram alpha knows about many and lots of things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica to be able to be with the kind of more precise , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> developed capacity , capable of a lot of lines to do .
so , with physical <unk> , we &apos;re used to be used to go and realize that certain materials make sense of technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are the special relativity and gravity and gravity and at least evidence on quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who had <unk> me to hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothing .
because my mother was a woman , she had no right to land on land , and automatically was all my family anyway , my father , so he had the right .
and the day of the actual ceremony we danced were excited , and they hadn &apos;t slept all night .
he was wearing eyes and this in a village that hasn &apos;t even <unk> streets . it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl girl , i would come back and do everything that she would ask me .
when it was pregnant when it was pregnant , the mother was made for responsible and punished .
as we speak here , 125 girls will never be <unk> again .
consumer , the 72 percent of the american gdp are actually , in fact , the <unk> and companies <unk> pay their <unk> , their <unk> , in everyday life , itself from obligations , even of obligations and taking risks that are going to us when we move forward .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually see is that we actually <unk> and essentially the future education , the future kids of our homes .
<unk> is just up 48 percent to the research institute .
we also observe a trend into something called tourism . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and the time of the neighbors as support .
we also see a big <unk> .
the trend is immense .
then we &apos;re going to take this phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i got the question , i &apos;m the only thing that does something like this ?
you could use it .
that &apos;s what i do in my life -- stories about novels , and today , i want to share with you a couple stories about storytelling , and also about some supernatural creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> could be stunted . our hearts could be stunted , and our <unk> could be <unk> , if we were always in our cultural <unk> lives .
i first came out there for the first time , as i call , &quot; representative <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no refugee or <unk> . i &apos;m going to ask why i &apos;m doing this , but the commute of languages that allow me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story was being a huge issue , because i was proven .
and the literature has to be a different side of the other side .
i could be <unk> about a muslim woman , and maybe that will be a happy story , and in my next book , i &apos;m going to write about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re already doing existing songs , cut them into little bits , and you can get this little bit , but this new song is clearly made out of old songs .
instead , these laws and laws are more unpleasant versus the property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;ll sum up what it is , <unk> alarm : the <unk> of the telephone , by a symbol of your fingers .
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see , &quot; what are you address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian . &quot;
what beautiful is , you can probably see this extremity there , a kind of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s from the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
so this led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so <unk> that atoms have a single core , with <unk> that circle around it .
this picture shows a galaxy , a <unk> , which is , , we know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it &apos;s also the <unk> ideas for us , about our place in the universe and really the value of our planet .
this is . this is home . that &apos;s where we &apos;re .
and with each click and every hand and every touch of the screen we can let &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information all over our way through the digital forests .
when our daughter went to the <unk> , i asked her , &quot; will be a lot of emphasis on your school much worth on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t be <unk> at this point .
now , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much argued and i decided to my 27th birthday , that i couldn &apos;t talk more than a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ... ?
and i explained to a friend who was my sign of my sign that i was john francis was that i was talking about it , and that this was the last time someone would translate my sign .
well , i <unk> my backpack again .
i started talking again because i had studied medical studies .
but the <unk> was that i thought about every birthday i thought about my silence , but never my decision to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found , and i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i &apos;m constantly worried that i would be back to be sent back to back again .
i felt so powerless because i had been so much to eat in america , but my father died .
but i think that your gesture of love and care of the lives of another joseph can change , and can change thousands of other <unk> , that still have the hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but it was much stronger than i &apos;d expect to waterproof and waterproof and to make the industrial <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my career as architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t help us work for society , but for privileged people , rich , the government , contractors .
and then in the following year , there was a big earthquake earthquake in japan in japan .
so i ask , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , even in the womb .
so fetuses are actually learning about even the specific language that &apos;s going to be born in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it creates a mixture of the effects that are so individually and curious about the woman themselves .
why should malnutrition lead to antiretroviral illness ?
you can see <unk> , but also , you can see with other eyes .
this confidence in the <unk> is essential for any kind of <unk> system .
the audience will be <unk> on <unk> , which are all of logical , but not with the front of what your eyes is happening . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , you may even get us smile .
you may remember that as the <unk> <unk> , ok , and then the biggest deal of all the time .
if you &apos;re a high animal in the world and someone says , &quot; what does you actually do for the turning hunger hunger ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a ad campaign ?
so this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue that the strategy is a role .
i was that music was the music .
now , if i use my software , this is the camera of the <unk> , and the point of the <unk> in the <unk> , and you already have a whiteboard .
i remember that the poor had had something to do a little bit of <unk> -- eat , clothing , housing -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a <unk> of shame .
now , i heard him , i was excited for different reasons .
i didn &apos;t even have a donation to what was really my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving us a way to give themselves a way to get a way to get a partnership to be , a partnership that would be <unk> , a partnership that &apos;s going to happen in a traditional way of a donation .
it &apos;s a very far <unk> combination , a very powerful combination .
now , the moment is a very beginning of the beginning , and it &apos;s really palpable for me , so that it &apos;s only a vehicle , only a tool .
what does the future of humanity ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : we are alone , or are there in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
see this one .
here &apos;s photos of myself .
even every 18 months , all 18 months and every single member of the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> law .
but what about you ? what will it be doing with you ?
they sail sailing in their saucer over the sky , and occasionally , they put people for experiments that your parents would not agree .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
earlier generations , these experiments couldn &apos;t do at all .
and i found out that the first technology is actually turned out of a <unk> million years ago in the form of <unk> .
we can learn a lot of them .
and i &apos;m looking at <unk> and try to protect my child , because with such a child you don &apos;t give anyone alone , even a minister .
and the second thing she tells us that you had a <unk> gang but some of the <unk> of the trees .
until now , our ancestors came to our ancestors in principle of adults , because the fossils , the <unk> , were missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> explores the origins of humankind in the vast community . he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a <unk> child and what we can learn in africa about our human mortality .
and if everyone should be the rules , you need to be an effective system to the review and <unk> , because we &apos;ve seen , in most of trust is that we can also trust control .
it &apos;s considered as high seas because the continent was <unk> from <unk> .
we need to work locally , but also <unk> lake <unk> .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay for the to do what i do . &quot;
now , that &apos;s a pretty good idea .
so , to clear , i &apos;m a journalist , not technologist , so i want to make a sketch of a sketch , like the present and the future will look like .
and then i think , we need to think about whether we want to think about whether we want our reality -- and if , what it is for our idea of life and everything that comes after .
it looks like crude oil .
the symptoms of the complex is that you have the strong and <unk> opinion , the right solution , no matter how difficult the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and explaining how it works .
of course we can .
and they make a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the americans americans .
we &apos;re going to try and it &apos;s probably all wrong .
<unk> immediately . &quot;
<unk> tried to repeat it again , but he could never prove the presumption .
i suggest that our approach is not portable .
china wants to have achieved in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s going to be ugly , and yes , it happens soon -- with certainty in our lifetime -- but we &apos;re more than capable of getting everything that &apos;s going to emerge .
and here &apos;s where they come into .
and what we need to think about is this : if you &apos;re going to go into the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can put this debt to our children , but it &apos;s a moment of you .
everything else is <unk> .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what is the cell is the cell .
that shouldn &apos;t be amazing ?
all we get is <unk> .
you will be able to focus your hearing may increase the sensitivity or <unk> can &apos;t do that , you can &apos;t do .
that &apos;s not 1,000 years in the distance .
we should be able to use this cheap , simple <unk> , not to use them for your kids . &quot;
and here we can see this one of the overall .
we cannot risk that we can &apos;t have to lose customers .
he only got 500 to get 500 and chance to get 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge jar of <unk> , he got her , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when they &apos;re still sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we &apos;re all talking about -- is <unk> slightly less than 5,000 days .
of course , there &apos;s the internet since over 5,000 days -- the web is only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re going to say is a <unk> , a human brain if we look at the rate that we &apos;re growing up in 30 years , it &apos;s six billion <unk> .
now it &apos;s not so -- if you make a chart and things in the work , a word , you &apos;re not part of the web but they will be . you &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will make the extended senses of machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas , if they want to dissolve .
the final point i want to talk about is the idea we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
third , it will be ubiquitous , it will be in the environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i convinced that the second <unk> of jesus christ had occurred to be moon , and that i was being prepared by god and prepared to become his <unk> .
these are the dead from <unk> .
and it allows everything . it makes all logically .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we &apos;re things .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just completed in <unk> for a giant <unk> project that came directly from this process , it &apos;s a number of forces that are going to develop .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false mindset because the mash-up is probably the agent .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are young people &apos;s education , young people .
and the end of one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of them is going to be in his neighbors .
so , as we would have to pay school fees .
so we have a big brain , a big benefit because we can affect the environment .
my story is the two brains . it may surprise , our gut has a <unk> brain .
this <unk> is very , very important to be able to be able to be able to see it .
we &apos;ve learned to talk about the great brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , someday we were all of the animals and then not . &quot;
these are men and women who are still used to be in the night sky .
of course , the <unk> monks that they said .
the <unk> , the <unk> , the sun is actually a <unk> that &apos;s constantly reflected on the sacred <unk> of machu picchu , the <unk> , called <unk> picchu .
when you pray for the dead , you &apos;re doing this gestures with the hands , with which you &apos;re looking up in the sky .
here &apos;s where the great mother has the <unk> in the world has <unk> the mountains and the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the world .
it &apos;s unique <unk> of human imagination .
this material you &apos;re all familiar with is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s rather like toxic stuff .
i &apos;m looking at it , you can fit in , because in a hundred years , my body can go back to the earth again .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and not to care about <unk> or <unk> , because you have many alternatives .
first of atoms , they start in a special bottle .
i started a competition called &quot; dancing your <unk> . &quot;
my country is to go with 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot of <unk> than all the speakers in front of me and all the ones that come to me .
and they thought about my work on mathematical models that should be understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not have <unk> -- from deep , cultural reasons , and find it for boring -- and find another pattern of more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two ways of thinking about it .
if you take a coin , they get a sequence of your head and number .
back to the more secular <unk> , because of those who you think of uncertainty .
and only one percent more than it .
he <unk> : &quot; i suppose that &apos;s a sudden death death in a family that remains the likelihood of another . &quot;
not as improbable one in 73 million , but it &apos;s pretty unlikely .
the whole quality control , the <unk> implications of industrial processing , is the <unk> of statistics .
the <unk> has saved hundreds of thousands of life around the world .
a smart power doesn &apos;t prevent injury because the electricity is always made , until a smart <unk> that will be recognized .
but , on the other hand , china is a <unk> . a term <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;ve facebook , we have <unk> .
yet , the <unk> itself can produce a very powerful force , which has never been in the history of china .
so the chinese view of this <unk> as real medium , not only as mere <unk> .
how a big ted , right ?
so in the last three years , <unk> <unk> <unk> really changed , they really changed more and more transparent because that don &apos;t have access to the data .
increasingly , more chinese see more of speech and human rights as their human rights , instead of the privilege of america .
many of you know that this is <unk> seventh symphony .
i don &apos;t say they can &apos;t really wonderful life alive .
girl : well , my sister can pretty much nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like its <unk> <unk> to try to try to see the death of death , which is why the sound of <unk> was going to be in the side of the pages .
cl : joseph &apos;s phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
when i <unk> myself , in this <unk> audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
in this critical point in the dutch story , my father was on the bank of the <unk> river in the <unk> river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression , since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as the peace peace .
peter van <unk> : why i took a gun .
this program gets a form and then it spits 250 of sequences sequences .
this is a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in the middle of the yosemite .
you cannot let &apos;s not really loosely let &apos;s leave . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in the very two .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this . but there is actually a theoretical rationale for why technology is evolved in the way .
now evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , the evolution of the process of basically the technology of the technology is to produce the next level , which is the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world , we can use the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent growth in the year .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
to go back to our exponential growth : 1,000 dollars on computing , for the time about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to be able to get full mature of these trends , and they have to pay for how often that screw the <unk> in the form of technology -- faster and faster , if we get to that point .
you can see your blessing and <unk> .
they &apos;re more difficult .
they were removed from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s not a little bit .
dopamine is , it &apos;s really the stuff that is linked in relation to <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we call schizophrenia .
and he was so easy to post and to try and give us the angular .
i mentioned in our little thought , and they were a <unk> in the african plain .
september 11 has a <unk> . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own <unk> , and we have a <unk> product .
i wasn &apos;t as good as he , but we did , <unk> n &apos; <unk> , <unk> <unk> and bruce <unk> on a <unk> for amnesty , and that was a great experience .
they used to say , &quot; the truth and again , &quot; we &apos;ll get us the truth .
musician and activist peter gabriel explains his personal motivation , with the <unk> <unk> for human rights and shares stories of the <unk> .
so next , we asked us what do it ?
he sees the problem and white and it knows how the dance is to be able to orient yourself .
they don &apos;t eat much less particles on the pill if they were doing on a little bit of <unk> when they don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our <unk> experimenter .
let &apos;s play a <unk> and see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it makes fun to fall into these great adventure , right , not entirely with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s going to be a <unk> in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation is to convince the vc is that they &apos;re entrepreneurs in which they invest and a lot of money to do it .
and next to the experience of a company , to conduct something -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there is no financial integrated companies , which there are no problems .
from the way you take it -- on a solid solid , right upward , right from the end .
if i have to know someone who made such a device .
no , they &apos;re not .
then they give me a quick <unk> .
even if the competition is working on the way ...
hopefully it was positive positive , positive , positive , even more positive .
if you &apos;re going to follow my ideas , you &apos;ll have a <unk> , very <unk> presentation , and that &apos;s great to <unk> who they are and to get emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that it &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you imitate something that you might have a effect on it .
and if you get it enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , in the last place , as the culture , the innovation is not estimate .
so as we think and behave , our <unk> power is broken .
we have a <unk> memes -- seriously .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems today of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very bleak .
our thinking is backwards .
by a change change , the change , like transparency , change , like <unk> , and collaboration , working together , and working together , not <unk> , these things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only thing is , the only way to do is the only way for us to get rid of the old <unk> , to get rid of the <unk> of the problems of the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can transform bulgaria into something better .
the magazine called the <unk> magazine , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the <unk> , because the <unk> was in the time .
so after i had her hand aside , i had been very -- i was very excited , and i was working on for six months .
i had a fire at nine days ago .
you already know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , <unk> and henry .
we were laughing quite magazines , our homework , but where we were looking at , we were surrounded by images like this .
this image was literally in a <unk> , after me , the baby was placed in the arm , and i brought it over .
rg : oh , oh .
av : taboo number three : about his miscarriage , you don &apos;t speak -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life is to be better than the <unk> of birth and family <unk> .
but you realize that you &apos;re looking at the way that you &apos;re looking at the way that you &apos;re in a wonderful way , which is how we think , our lives are very much meaning and what is extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there is a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all this &quot; star <unk> &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine , big , already <unk> <unk> today , how you would play in , john <unk> walker , how footage can analyze the exact and <unk> analysis , to cut them on <unk> wings .
well , since we &apos;ve seen a time of extraordinary economic <unk> , the longest <unk> in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians have to take to bite the <unk> apple without biting the mine without the mine , &quot; how someone would be like someone , their uncertainty , you can &apos;t hide .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i &apos;ve met this guy , a time , messy man who had been fed by <unk> and iron and iron .
but interestingly , that &apos;s really static , in the way that society is a few <unk> from capitalism , which is how to <unk> the dna of dna in society , and then those who work , and then those who work , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on the structure of the language that they &apos;re talking about , and their tilt for saving .
and if i want to speak right , the force force me to think about it .
well , that &apos;s a <unk> theory .
you put this device so she &apos;s going to do this device , so she can measure your <unk> hand , so i can measure their <unk> .
it &apos;s the present of the future of the future .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how much the ability to communicate over generations .
we have the teacher &apos;s constantly .
but i &apos;m about it as a hurdle .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
at the same time i was in the field of the <unk> , although i was a <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
people and <unk> and birds and everything , the red line goes up . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on serious <unk> of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this was flying around the party night , and -- you can see , like it &apos;s just <unk> , and you can see every single <unk> you want to do .
and he was unhappy about how people &apos;s buddhist muslim religion in india at the time .
and he goes back to the village of <unk> man .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so <unk> , the <unk> and everything .
animals are in one of your human lives . people are people .
we we have a lot of time . we take the feeling of memory of a mother and a lot of this in all the living creatures in this meditation .
and you think about how <unk> things are when they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re happy .
and of course they &apos;re cruel and <unk> toward others .
although the change in your spirit is something for other living systems , and you feel these new quality of you , and it &apos;s helping them as a role model .
so the coffee cup is , or the cup of dealing with one of the society used to get tools to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard of bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very , very simple once you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four <unk> remarks , an example , and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop the details , but in the bottom right corner , you see an example of what we have .
did you start to do that ?
and this is a <unk> of the things that <unk> on the things , which jimmy talked about , what our new kind of organization is , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are always going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do in the process of work , in collaboration with the <unk> .
let &apos;s take astronomy that yochai has mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be <unk> , professional argument .
so there &apos;s no dispute of two camp , but between that stored , it will be all kinds of interesting positions that are going to be taken by people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to devote their <unk> someone , and actually , a team then did it was , between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for him .
but the truth is , that &apos;s exactly the life that &apos;s happening .
so the people called people , and they have the messages on and have the news that you leave .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman , to true my anonymity . &quot;
and the one that didn &apos;t have done by the way , so where it turns out that they had just been taken in a different city and a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the foundation of everything , from the data , and dopamine , and things like to the <unk> .
and some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
that was one of those cases because there was no force of violence under their ancestors . but in my father .
they &apos;re so much like that you can only be .
and by the way , i &apos;ve been an email one morning , which is that we &apos;ve been completed the last part of atlas .
and these guys are the weak force , which may be known at least .
so , if you want to know why the sky is blue , or the atomic detects , you should be basically , with a computer structure -- why dna has the shape that you &apos;re now .
the comparison is that people are in this room the higgs particle .
but it &apos;s really so that with this theory of the physics of the physical <unk> at the time of the big bang . it seems absolutely wonderful prediction . the model has not created with the goal that this is happening , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this beautiful image that it turns into light and it allows the civilization to see the civilization from all .
another great insight came from a study of a <unk> who &apos;s wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball <unk> <unk> <unk> players from the <unk> years .
in a similar study in germany , researchers to measure <unk> in the <unk> and after they had <unk> into the face of their face to suppress the smiles .
&quot; because the colors you &apos;ve got to order , not the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? were there more officers ? &quot;
we built the bright <unk> people who brought people from <unk> , to think that they were traveling abroad , when they were <unk> to <unk> their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it . &quot;
all of these <unk> came together and provided charge beams for cellphones .
an visualization for the transformative is transformative power of technology in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion smartphones to the world .
in the stores of the environment were <unk> , batteries and bread .
this is the time in everything : in the absence of a <unk> , in the <unk> , which is the rose .
read a interview with a writers ?
and also , when i look at the great bear , i remember as a kid on his head to jump off his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen as creative technology and we can do in our lives and our lives and our own , we can choose those solutions , innovations and moments that the river of time not <unk> , but again .
my mother was <unk> .
in every single refugee camp , they had to <unk> , who had my older brother &apos;s nine brother , who was nine , and wanted to make a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take anything that you want to have , from the suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> because i don &apos;t <unk> my emotions .
thank you .
almost all life on earth is going to be about five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should that be a role ?
so theoretically , we can grow any organ of any cell in any cell .
here &apos;s the five-meter increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the upshot of the past .
so if the rotors is , if the rotors is , the robot is , the robot .
and you see how resilient control is control .
and he &apos;s doing that while he <unk> .
they take your neighbors true .
this is what we show is that we double the fossil record , triple , more than more than to get more than to make teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where he wants to go .
i can feel that , but there &apos;s so many , and i want to expand your horizon , and your view of honeybees are changing .
and so many years , this is a huge problem for many years , basically since the late 1980s , which is the <unk> of different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
they don &apos;t experience that .
they take cooks for their dishes . and the honey -- there are <unk> -- they use the honey to your bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are dying when they stick , they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , really , the question is , why is this ?
of course , we have it , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of <unk> to <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before , so many people were not aware of this .
in fact , not many of them don &apos;t know that our bread is not the european invention .
and especially the meat in <unk> and china is powering the <unk> .
<unk> has been most people , and there are not many farmers among them to be bad to be the environment , to be in great scale , the environment .
everything is going together .
and so while i &apos;m doing here , i finished my bread -- and i &apos;m trying to burn it . and i &apos;m not trying to burn the hands .
and also , it has to keep it for a long time to keep the tools available to the available tools , materials and <unk> .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyzed and testing and a new technology , and determines the quantitative <unk> .
because i hope you today , is a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
that &apos;s a year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them , and shekhar kapur turned a film about her , <unk> queen , who should see her .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but here &apos;s <unk> as <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient that was in the time that was the time , he was necessarily a bypass , but it was going to be .
i like this slide because you can talk about what the people really motivated to change and what don &apos;t .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans eat more fat because the one , and even more carbs , and even more carbs , but it &apos;s the only bit higher , but the only thing is to reduce the way .
one of the most <unk> <unk> studies found that 70 percent of the people were congested , 65 percent of people had bad breath , <unk> percent had had headaches -- that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , everything is a intimacy of <unk> .
i hope it doesn &apos;t hang on .
the film is based on a <unk> of f. scott &apos;s <unk> .
two <unk> were involved in this project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to do the <unk> and technology .
we &apos;re so <unk> from motion .
the number seemed to be expandable .
and that &apos;s what we get it and then we get it to the model of the model .
and so the finished image was used in the film .
this was a very , very , very early rehearsal .
and we found this , in the middle of karnataka .
and it has its own <unk> .
the people of <unk> are going to transcend <unk> and <unk> past , in which they lived lived .
we were too <unk> -- two of them as a driver -- and imagine it &apos;s a ocean from sand , 40 degrees , a water bottle .
i think camel is the best <unk> animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you another film .
i don &apos;t <unk> until my body temperature is passed away from 40 degrees celsius -- enough to be too much .
<unk> , thank you for inviting me .
start a person with a poem . that &apos;s an idea .
but how would you like to do if they never knew how to do the next day , like a living , the world &apos;s life , your shoulders in the clouds , or if you &apos;re sitting down there , right ?
who could be quiet in this night ?
but guess you know that judy was <unk> on your age , that <unk> d was <unk> the <unk> of the french army , and blaise pascal had cleaned his room -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator ?
at the end , they sat in a tree and one hand your hand on the other .
and the human <unk> is more than that , but would you remove these two columns , probably probably not much left .
and also , we have the problem with elephants that you can &apos;t build construction , which would be a single elephant .
one component of this is understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; the ability to understand the emotions of the other . &quot;
now we now look more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
the test doesn &apos;t well take well for them .
there is a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher wrote us that it was impossible to be that the monkeys had a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely kooks ; it &apos;s not two kooks ; three is a lot and a lot of power .
the last decade i spent trying to be able to <unk> pain and humiliation , hopefully , for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i stopped , in a way it was a success .
over the years , the serious <unk> can create .
a.j. jacobs : how life is to me care about
and i think many <unk> are going to view this view .
one really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically <unk> and they were <unk> , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask the story of the story that &apos;s not about .
... a preacher ?
now , the last thing is another group that believes the indus people are the ancestors of people in the today .
on the right on the left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful at the <unk> , to create more data that are the <unk> .
this signs is the number of the indus script , and just in this text it seems twice .
it turns out that it &apos;s been a long tradition of the base of <unk> on the base of the time of birth to the time .
space , we all know how it looks like .
this wire <unk> <unk> the <unk> who would call the name bell famous .
jansky had made the historical discovery that the same as <unk> can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
in fact , all the young people of the city .
someone who &apos;s sitting next to you -- this is a <unk> , but you would sit on a <unk> , and someone would sit down to you , then they would <unk> .
the dalai lama always says -- he says if you can make the idea of the <unk> of the <unk> , it &apos;s because you realize that you and your pain and their own <unk> and their joys of their own intelligence .
so , you take this wonderful thing that <unk> us , and they were killing us with a <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> was a <unk> , which was a symbol of the resistance for the world .
but what do they would have done anything else if they had the modern communications , to make a sense that was wrong that was going to be done immediately ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate on global level and global level with the challenges that we now , and the most part of global nature .
in the museum of children in rwanda , there is a photograph of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of the children who were left in the life that was left a million people in the age of rwanda people .
here &apos;s the task : help me to build a dynamic , <unk> <unk> in 3d .
they can move on very different stages -- they vary in the <unk> , the movement of the surface and the <unk> .
this is <unk> algae on the <unk> algae .
boy : <unk> .
so we slow spines to see the spikes in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford , one of my partner is an extraordinary engineer , which is a technology called <unk> <unk> manufacturing , where he can <unk> claws directly into an artificial foot .
they &apos;re looking at almost <unk> , and the secret to stick , they &apos;re toes .
here we move the band-aid .
these <unk> structures allow the spines , <unk> and the <unk> , to very <unk> , hard surfaces .
so , the <unk> of a beautiful <unk> of the songs that are used as a <unk> and the males as they could use to find each other and to choose a mate .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet away from each other , they have to produce less than half of the time .
if we think of marine marine reserves , as dolphins think , we need to be aware about the consequences of our surgeries that we &apos;re right .
after the <unk> , the marine <unk> has made the marine <unk> these systems to see what the scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to use a partner and find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , imagine what &apos;s the <unk> of the population of the population .
as ships can be made by <unk> , they found that with a better <unk> <unk> of that noise can reduce by 90 percent .
it <unk> the speed for 50 percent .
we see strange worlds , we see strangers <unk> , 300 times , and it will always become more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you &apos;ve all the possibilities to do .
we &apos;re seeing a continual growth in the men .
and obviously , there &apos;s a hundred , a hundred .
with initiatives like the 100 laptop laptop , it &apos;s a whole new generation of people in the old <unk> computer , and the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think nothing &apos;s going to do that problem .
our daily lives , but they said , in an extraordinary state , we say in a <unk> .
usually it is one or two per year .
and there is it .
but we &apos;re much more more populous .
part of the challenge was to try and try and <unk> , and i don &apos;t just my hands -- juggling is much more <unk> -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they &apos;re playing .
ok , because you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s a <unk> , i &apos;ll give you a little bit of .
now , again , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have someone on top of the top of the <unk> principle , that &apos;s all of all of you to do this whole life ?
lg -- and then it gets to calm . just a little bit about time .
with space and straight in the room in other ways .
and then <unk> levels .
in this year -- you may show the slides -- in this year , we have the <unk> with us , a project where we have helped the other other in design .
we &apos;re going to call this on a <unk> , which allows you to put more information about the clothing , while you &apos;re in the <unk> .
scott adams : i &apos;ve realized that i &apos;m going to be in the way of the foremost expert in the <unk> .
and we &apos;re now known a new product tonight , it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s been shown in the public domain .
right now , the farmers only can only take in the season , and not in the <unk> harvest .
electrons are disappearing in a kind of <unk> , and then only energy is not even energy . and energy you can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought he was .
potatoes , potatoes , you have a <unk> chromosomes . have it known ?
okay . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the sense of it , <unk> ?
we &apos;ve got to <unk> over four years .
if google is a book , you get it into a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the 40s , everybody was excited .
but you know , it &apos;s not going to be interested in .
but also also a lot of the right on the right , which seems to be by propaganda .
if you &apos;re going to see the <unk> , it &apos;s a &quot; <unk> &quot; with a a.
if i &apos;m going to go back to this pink sound for longer than a few minutes , you would literally stop it .
many people can escape , but these are going to be <unk> , all of these , public spaces like this , multiple <unk> , in a small personal <unk> .
you can also do that in a nice place like a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i was , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you for you here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they were not at us on the pavement and couldn &apos;t see the exchange of me and i was doing , and i was doing , and i was doing , a exchange of us , but <unk> of us .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the last year , there was much competition in the last year , because the arab spring is still going to change in , the <unk> is the <unk> -- which is the ?
this photograph was actually smuggled in a police station , and on the ground , you see the <unk> of the people who are tracking by the police .
the kids just do a single photos in a class where teachers get them , they paste them on the <unk> .
in the talk today , it &apos;s about the brain and , you know , somewhere out there is a <unk> .
this is something that we can work in our lifetimes . i thought i can &apos;t find a difference and so i tried to get out of the <unk> , and i was going to get into the <unk> .
but sometimes science has some other features that really really make interesting .
what do we bring up with more data ?
there is something we think it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t think of alligator as much intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we &apos;ve evolved the most <unk> part of the <unk> with the name part of the neocortex , and nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not so that you &apos;re looking at this and say , &quot; what am i &apos;m seeing ?
not like a <unk> . not at least like a <unk> .
these are the things that will be first .
we need something to the police , we need a little military , but only to defense .
you can see it on her . &quot;
she was traveling because they were the time of the election outside the country .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when she got the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
she &apos;s washing up with hand .
this group is consuming three , everybody one .
it &apos;s real .
she made it to learn english and learn to learn this as a foreign language .
the computer is already , and in one of three people .
so if you know , you think differently as the employers of the united states , which actually were part of our <unk> , because that &apos;s what we did .
we went through the experiment with the same groups , but a delay one of a sudden , a delay one of the enlightenment , and how we deal with the data and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price of the price is displacement from paradise .
and they moved and rubbed each other and rubbed their arms up to each other and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at the skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at the way to speak about characters .
then you &apos;re going to start personal instructor that <unk> <unk> <unk> against bad breath in <unk> .
i don &apos;t really feel that with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to peer and find out what you offer .
they own <unk> humility .
that &apos;s what &apos;s unconscious mind .
we found them between <unk> , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and it &apos;s not normal , in a home .
what was my challenge ?
you need your empathy .
lexicography : the process of &quot;
well , first , i don &apos;t give it the queen because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- see if somebody thinks in a place , and then you won &apos;t find it on the map , then he thinks , &quot; this card sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to use our minds , where you know that are better than hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different <unk> definitions of &quot; set . &quot;
and then there mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in the u.k.
i have the time &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
so , i &apos;m a chair .
and to make a long story short , i &apos;ve got to get it .
and so , play with a piece of play , while this three days , you start to understand , and why am i hear this stuff of this stuff ?
you may be from a ted speaker , and so we can go to run the conversation during the year and next year and next year , the same intellectual and emotional travel .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the <unk> in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public is going to start with the precise <unk> that can actually be able to fold on the palm of the palm of the palm of the palm .
there was unsure whether it was already <unk> , and it wasn &apos;t really able to find the channel .
instead of making the <unk> , you can &apos;t be fooled .
and , &quot; you can trust trust . &quot;
we call our <unk> &amp; amp ; and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a <unk> man .
we debate about the case of what the world needs now is nuclear energy , &quot; right ?
and so far , there &apos;s only three <unk> of this -- coal and gas , the <unk> that &apos;s already used to -- and nuclear energy .
we have become the russian warheads that we &apos;ve turned into electricity by electricity .
<unk> emissions are the largest emissions of greenhouse gases and particles , and the warming and the warming is being transformed to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons with the prevalence of nuclear , because we know , for example , that india and pakistan secretly <unk> nuclear weapons from <unk> in <unk> .
for wind , the surface is much bigger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states of nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need to have the support of both parties -- only one or two voices are necessary to be in the senate , and this auditorium can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewable sources .
i used to worry about the 10 years of the time .
thank you .
that was -- my motivation was been rejected by apollo .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that will allow us to allow us to explore the exploration of space .
26 groups of seven countries were going to the competition , every one was between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them to the space station .
and the supply of sponsors is the sum of the <unk> and the social security system .
would you surprise us , i &apos;m excited about it ?
that means that surfaces can be able to cut themselves . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can put this new algorithmic order to an pillar .
what i didn &apos;t know about the time because we only had seen the outside , was that the areas of themselves are moving on , within the column , and that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of user cells , michael <unk> algorithms , which creates incredible , <unk> forms of <unk> , no human could create it by hand , but you can build them , and you could build our understanding of architecture .
so , look at this picture , many shapes , dance here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was designed for cancer .
you can see , the chip actually is actually the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s going to be led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room , many of them are in the same position .
so i think women are going to be leaders in our society because they realize that it is very important for your future generations to get our cultural identities .
we realized that for more people have more people to use youtube and social networks to show their stories , to show their photos and share their own voices with their own voices .
at the same time we invite them , and i &apos;m going to explore our part of the world .
so i was going to be more or less than &quot; not .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i make these ants a few apartments , they &apos;re going to go . &quot;
this was called a <unk> house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly , it &apos;s sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; that can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i took it around , and i grew up with the <unk> .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very <unk> work , but the best things come in little <unk> .
they expect their employees to do what they were doing , if you did the job , you can do better .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute <unk> of consciousness , awareness , an absolute heart of compassion , and love that characterizes the primary properties of divinity .
my <unk> body flew in the one direction , my <unk> wheel in the other .
i took all the walks of the layers that i probably probably not to do with them , the <unk> that i may not doom , the friends that i don &apos;t want to look like , the <unk> that i can &apos;t go with you .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> test .
and if you <unk> them from the back of the back , you can just over it , and it &apos;s <unk> in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors would have been off my leg and hoped there was a 15 <unk> of survival .
and how i was more empowered more than more than that moment in my life , i was probably 14 percent more lightweight than i now .
and nobody is , in my eyes , the modern <unk> in my eyes are more than david black .
so , you &apos;re going to run , you &apos;re the threshold of what makes us human .
it &apos;s president president &apos;s international coalition for <unk> , which is the most <unk> name , which i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born and a half months ago , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .
so once i tried to approach the piano , i became a big <unk> .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like the bumblebee &quot; doesn &apos;t have a problem , right ?
would you like to play me ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t <unk> it .
they &apos;re struggling to the same way of living in this forest in a world that &apos;s still clean , a world that even not even even <unk> , in a world that hasn &apos;t yet been polluted .
so we &apos;re now , that they &apos;re able to be able to do that the research for absolutely impossible to be impossible when i started .
the long time of <unk> , and the mother who evolved during this long childhood , and also the siblings , can stay alive for the way to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge <unk> of the forest is now meat , and so that &apos;s so , the presence of the <unk> and in their amazing lifestyle , so many hundreds of years , were spoiled .
yesterday , that was somebody .
we are now in every state , and the problems in florida are others as the in new york .
do you get to put me down here ?
where politicians did that ?
so what we want to do in the lab is so much the same , but with a few dozen different types of molecules -- so a <unk> reduction in complexity , but yet the attempt to create something more .
it &apos;s actually very <unk> . once you &apos;re doing it , you really don &apos;t really do something .
now where you &apos;re all experts for these protocells are we &apos;re going to play with these protocells play .
and we can see the self-assembly of this body of <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black colors in there represent these black sludge -- this <unk> , very complex , organic black sludge .
in his lab , martin <unk> <unk> protocells , which is <unk> <unk> of chemicals that are like living cells , and his work shows how life is going to be , and maybe even else else .
this is a <unk> to get your tadpole to a walk .
what &apos;s the -- where did you know ? they did it .
but if we did that at every time -- every fire hydrant , we could redefine the emergency .
and soot is the dirt that otherwise otherwise would be <unk> in their pretty pink lungs , and the one of the way .
birds could jump from one to another .
you can tell you the current news of him . you can talk to him .
but that herd is , is going to ask a huge toll of our planet .
and as we &apos;re going to do the skin cells , and multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> , for thousands of years , starting to <unk> , like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re doing all of our research all around our research , we see that there are almost a universal pursuit of people to own a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge energy energy energy that &apos;s to create mobile energy .
if we can see this <unk> future , that &apos;s also different .
you had to survive .
and we were sure to get an <unk> , to get financing and support .
because why should our students drive so far away from your home ?
it was a book , then to a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here on the west coast , they destroyed their forest .
but on this picture , you &apos;ve begun to build the <unk> , which was soon a big <unk> of brazil .
when i came to start to start my <unk> field , i &apos;ve studied the newly <unk> field of the <unk> field .
if you go into the south of the <unk> , you see the expansion of new york city , like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the <unk> protected places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> of meadows , insects , and it needs to be <unk> .
maybe there &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s so much force to combine science and visualizing each other , that these images are going to emerge and see the both sides of the <unk> .
and we &apos;re really really dramatic at our society now , and we &apos;re really dramatic .
so i don &apos;t have to go into it .
you can &apos;t be the pristine thing that &apos;s going to be .
this is a <unk> building .
so , one example that we &apos;re all familiar is that the cell phones right ?
and it turns out all of this question -- of course , in a very artistic and <unk> way .
but it happens everywhere , and these tools are parts of them to do it .
seriously , you &apos;re quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you could be a big problem for a rule , but congress don &apos;t seem to let &apos;s not too much .
but if you create a lot of high-quality copies and sold , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we &apos;ve done things that we found and have found every single one option in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very elite , <unk> , expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought , i &apos;m going to do a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
one is a professional one is somebody who is a combination of competence , confidence and persuasion .
when i said , they said , &quot; let &apos;s show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the whole electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how you &apos;re going to be arrested if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do is supposed to do if a animal is sick .
come into tensions , the presence of the school , it comes from teachers and parents , so , the teacher &apos;s <unk> , and the parents call the village and say , &quot; give you hands .
you use sign sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> created one of the largest , dynamic <unk> computers in the world of <unk> .
you see here the <unk> along the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;ve made for the artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , it &apos;s actually data that two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m doing it physically , financially , emotionally , mentally , mentally and in almost every other way , as much better . &quot; i don &apos;t have a minute .
he didn &apos;t <unk> it money , and of course , ray <unk> <unk> six months later , the same idea .
in this case , because it &apos;s because they &apos;re used in the experiment that i used to be used to be used by <unk> images .
we collected our materials , went out of the spinal room , for half half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they made two pictures , and they had two beautiful <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> of them , and we said , &quot; which is that they would ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of <unk> <unk> and say , &quot; you know , we give it a <unk> and we can make it in two different ways .
<unk> , the big car , and the large car , and the <unk> is beautiful .
voices : it &apos;s going to air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition doesn &apos;t come from the <unk> of <unk> , but then again , in a time , before we <unk> stories on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the kind of <unk> roof , you know .
and so we let my father &apos;s father , because i knew he would kill me if i left them alone , so we go into the car .
&quot; and , this guy had about a blue uniform on and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
does i really want to do it ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread to <unk> myself , to <unk> , enough metaphors for your taste ? — could it be that i never come back .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club to a secret .
she says , &quot; ma , you &apos;ve got to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m going to vote for the little old lady , damn time . &quot;
it &apos;s gone from the car . &quot;
i really fear .
so what is the social result of it ?
where are i going to go and who ?
and if we have it , we will decide how many miles we drive , where we live where we live and work .
so intelligent , in the <unk> , and you see exactly where your bus is just walking , and when it comes , and you can buy their tickets in time .
i want to do that we &apos;re wireless <unk> <unk> right now , and i urge that network to open standards for everyone .
and they came here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who got to mental illness in touch , knowledge , what can be a challenge .
i said i wanted to tell the <unk> of the <unk> , i wanted to share with you the three a fantastic and i wanted to leave her with a <unk> .
because they were all three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is simply a authentic person . and that &apos;s why it &apos;s about authenticity .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sleep .
j it &apos;s so many , that this is a problem .
i thought it was curious about this , as if it was a competition , which is so fresh , a <unk> .
it &apos;s a commodity , the commodity , rich <unk> , which was not representative of the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a <unk> .
people <unk> over two things -- they were astonished about the destruction , but there was also a sense of <unk> across the <unk> of new yorkers that i found very moving .
because at all of the four platforms , because at all of the <unk> , the <unk> version of a <unk> -- we knew that it &apos;s being flexible , to respond to <unk> conditions and the change of ground zero .
we have the ability to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know that children suffer every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody &apos;s <unk> here and a concussion <unk> , most of us , in a period of a few hours to a few hours to a few weeks .
you have to be familiar with the problems we &apos;re talking about today .
and it turns out , tom would be a helmet for 20 dollars a good way to keep a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s not true , but it happened to tony blair in 2005 as his doodles , of course , &quot; i discovered , and he was described as this .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in <unk> sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today all countries have committed to offer entrepreneurs to treat drugs that have been at least 20 years .
it &apos;s dependent on the <unk> of the company , their patents and make them available for other .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> , people sat in the <unk> sun , the afternoon at very high humidity and they didn &apos;t feel .
you can adjust everything to worry for your well-being .
he gives all those services , <unk> , so on a <unk> , so small things that you &apos;re going to go online , but for people who &apos;s just like this with the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you do that teacher
let &apos;s see what he does .
and the husband man daughter , he was also sick by the <unk> of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very large .
well , <unk> had a <unk> on our studies .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people get a different structural position within the network .
that &apos;s my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both of carbon , and yet one of those of them in themselves , which are in a special way , they &apos;re placed in a special way , on the left , and they get <unk> , the soft and dark .
to make it a little bit of <unk> , let me pull me out a moment .
you &apos;re not just to be just to be just .
under the same conditions , older people do their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more and memory , more than the negative information than in negative .
we cost life .
they would wish me , &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to perform this <unk> for this girl on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i said , actually , often , i don &apos;t know exactly what happens when i dance .
they have me brother and uncles and i called the uncle and i was invited over five years .
<unk> : the second treaty of fort laramie has clearly the spread of the vast sioux nation and the <unk> of the lakota over the holy black hills .
the treaty from fort laramie argued that at least three quarter of the <unk> sign to sign to the country .
they were the treaties .
the <unk> is eight times as high as the american average .
so what &apos;s going to stay ?
and today ? child mortality dropped since 1960 to add on five percent since 1960 .
you either have it as a pill or a bicycle . you have to take it every day to get the <unk> .
if we like here , you know , with people .
but basically , it makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s called : are they smarter than a <unk> ?
it &apos;s a very expensive car .
the problem with a bmw , this car is certainly .
now you will think , &quot; if my life depends on it , of course , i would use every day . &quot;
we have to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something else that is actually making an effective ad campaign .
what &apos;s not new .
light will become a light .
we do it for our customers .
we &apos;re going to be in the sun .
now -- logic -- logically , you know , you know , you can see this position in this position -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . now if every time -- another person -- not always the same answer .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some of a few of a second .
here &apos;s ... i have to look at all of the time to follow my maps during the <unk> -- oh , we should have to start with -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what card is i supposed to use ? the lady or the five ?
lg : you can see your hand .
wait moment , you please , take some card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yeah ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all of the cards are covered -- there -- all the cards are shining -- right ?
and the last king , the king -- in the same ... five seconds .
some of you seem to know this kid .
after i was back , i made my whole company to a <unk> . &quot;
if you &apos;re not hearing a musical hearing , you could not turn off the <unk> .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i always say , &quot; if you put a fallacy , and then it recognizes everybody . &quot;
imagine the person and follow the same way from b to e , and you &apos;re going to hear everything that the chopin had to say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , was a <unk> , and i was a realization .
she came back to auschwitz when she was 15 years old . her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for the other thing for tasks , this <unk> , not work , doesn &apos;t work -- often often , and they often do it .
think about your own work .
the standard of living is lower .
these are the building blocks of a completely new <unk> for our businesses .
this one day intense autonomy has been led to a whole series of <unk> that may never have been given .
make it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is used because of its light &apos;s weight .
in a series of 55 spheres , they &apos;re contracting , in proportion , every sphere and their distances are relative to this little world .
and the blue side , the <unk> , the <unk> , is in the other direction .
this has evolved with a lot of <unk> .
the <unk> on the object would probably be a highly <unk> picture of the earth .
but it &apos;s always going to be this 10 percent of the more <unk> , which is most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and in a club for <unk> dollars .
charitable organizations have to help themselves , bold , large engineered , to try and be able to try and be able to fail to fly from the dirt .
so what should you do ?
the overhead continues .
dan <unk> : our thinking about charity is <unk>
then it was the <unk> listeners , yes , which is so their part of the music .
people who made these <unk> , the <unk> , all these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about execution of music as it is written , not about interpretation . &quot;
that &apos;s great . and what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what it does .
you know , the authority is available when it &apos;s needed . it &apos;s very important .
kleiber is about the process .
as a <unk> , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and about what steps we could do from here .
there are 98 of the world around 98 countries .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that makes really joy .
you wonder if they should continue to move it further .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have the transition vaccine , we have to invent these entire community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there is a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced , and to a certain degree of the games that they &apos;re playing to drop to drop that , which is so very , so you can &apos;t see what they &apos;re really quite obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states , which are worse , and really only four states that that &apos;s not to be on .
and even if they were doing it , they could deliver money there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> when i was visiting <unk> <unk> , and i was in a <unk> in my life , and i tried to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks said , a young lady i knew that sex may be so good for the five senses .
the one of the time , the one of the <unk> , is all five senses at an extreme level .
of course , the five senses are not the only thing that makes interesting life .
we &apos;re all born as an artist .
if you have this conversation , the child has to come up to the next answer to <unk> what it started .
but your parents tell you , &quot; it &apos;s going to pull all of the waves . &quot;
but kids usually do art for fun . it &apos;s playing .
but you rarely find a teacher .
in <unk> , there are always people who are <unk> <unk> , &quot; hotel california , as they imitate <unk> .
right in this minute , we can take off the tv off , and <unk> them off from the internet , you start and start to do something .
the students fall in a kind of trance .
he said it &apos;s been profile . &quot; and what &apos;s they ? &quot; i asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start with that point .
it will be more storms and greater storms .
if you &apos;re , it will be a warming .
but the delay delay is exactly the expectation .

this is by daniel <unk> <unk> in the u.k. .
maybe you &apos;ve all been clear for you all for long , but for me , so often i &apos;ve encountered this hard day every day , i &apos;ve never seen this <unk> challenge .

<unk> city .
and he &apos;s got the snout of it . he &apos;s tired of his friends to have his family and his community .

imam <unk> : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of <unk> is the 2011 of 2011 .
the net combines all of the network , and it will be able to convey a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous is feeding <unk> its <unk> information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me how he was in new york to tour , took 10,000 dollars from the cash given here , 30,000 dollars from the atm machines .
he was born in a stable and respect class family , his obsession with play as teenagers led him to the <unk> .
and most of the , with the exception of script and <unk> , they don &apos;t have real social qualities in the outside world -- just in the net .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into this detail , but some of the mention .
but they &apos;re all defined by the market , and what &apos;s the market is the market , is , is the great demographic <unk> .
we also found a lot of examples of empty big boxes that are actually transformed in all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many schools , many schools , and many libraries like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets of <unk> , by the <unk> of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped us to engage that eight of 13 local <unk> <unk> in <unk> plans to be <unk> .
the bach was replaced by the parking lot .

it &apos;s about a gender , which is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way it exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real sense of our minds , that this schism has created a division that can often escape from the decision .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings because that &apos;s how much as happiness with the happiness and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s been a lot of small south carolina that &apos;s not much smaller than today , and once of a future as a independent country .
well , maybe he was too , he was too , because he stayed where he was , for a long time after the nazis , and even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; let me find the best workers that you can find , and if they &apos;re good enough , i &apos;m going to be a . &quot;
and so clearly it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; uh-huh ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to film . &quot;
as i said , he &apos;s too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re taking care of the most painful time and order to order the other for the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to , during the soviet union time .
and if you think it &apos;s not , it &apos;s just pay for long to keep it .
so what i want to try to do -- i hope this points to indicate .
and what i &apos;d like to point later in the presentation later , 50 percent of the united states is under the ocean .
it &apos;s because the photons can achieve the pristine depth of the ocean , which is <unk> miles .
and so we drove along the <unk> of the <unk> in a field next to the <unk> , and then the lack of heat there .
so i started to develop a new <unk> , with a <unk> that replaced me , and i don &apos;t have to go up in my car .
we find the status of the <unk> .
and i looked at it yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a child without license control of my tax system .
in some parts of the world , for example , south africa , is just not hard to do it .
when we saw the effect of the <unk> , and i decided to do that we had to do it up to so many people as possible to offer the best of education .
what was the special special thing about these courses ?
the video will be interrupted all of the few minutes and the student will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities that multiple <unk> is not so bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask yourself what the highest misunderstanding are and how you can help the students , these things .
we actually see the beginning of either through a personalized <unk> , or by <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what i was thinking about what infinity means when i was a kid .
and of course , in our society , it &apos;s mostly about to make the reality of others .
i mean , i think about the values of newtonian science , like rationality , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a <unk> .
so , you can understand my surprise when i was in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the head of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , said , ayn rand is his <unk> mentor .
i think you can do that funny , who have the ones and not have the ones that have no , and so , in this , i don &apos;t have a joke about kenneth <unk> and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;ve been right now , i &apos;ve been <unk> at this old times of the <unk> , that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
he said , i &apos;d have to take more respect to him because it can take more respect to 18 years to be a really good <unk> .
huh ? yeah ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i fear that &apos;s in somebody like us .
i &apos;ve been thinking about beauty , i think about beauty that she tells us yesterday . &quot; hyde in his book , which trickster can sometimes be able to be beauty .
george bush : what the defense of security costs is , and what the defense of our freedom is costing , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , not astronomer in the world , i &apos;ve got to the idea -- well , very few astronomers -- that there &apos;s planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he <unk> the time that an experiment wrong with a particle accelerator and a cerebral effect , the world was destroyed .
we need to be the same with biotechnology in the same level of <unk> .
we don &apos;t want to see that , of course , we don &apos;t want .
what can we do in the way ?
and now the worst thing .
we use very much money on it , we don &apos;t have to make sure that we don &apos;t die in a <unk> , but we don &apos;t give it nearly . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to be caught in the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important because this is the system that &apos;s the <unk> , which is the <unk> of life on the planet , and it &apos;s now at the time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing realization . and we just know it for recently .
and that &apos;s what the system is , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in this circles .
everybody who comes to get it down to the database , and can easily submit the information that will be done for everything that &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re about to ride the wave , the <unk> possibilities .
in a earthquake , huge amounts of these new microbes that we &apos;ve never seen before .
<unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and chemical , which is our ocean to the global , interactive laboratory -- and the <unk> of the world &apos;s depth .
so , i think optimism is going to move forward forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the <unk> against the absence . you know , too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will be unexpected .
but i rather rather unfamiliar , and even with mistakes , rather than the same time , so that it &apos;s <unk> from its insignificance .
risks that are never as <unk> as they should be in a single city .
there are the emotions of victims .
daniel <unk> is building at very big ideas . he &apos;s called <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative quest .
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the car of the size .
can &apos;t really be able to do something like this , or it &apos;s just going to be a few of <unk> ?
em : it &apos;s got to be simple . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and leapt , <unk> the <unk> on the roof and the <unk> , or <unk> a monthly <unk> , which is lower than the total time .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve got to move around here .
it &apos;s like a jet jet .
how about everything in the world could be incredibly innovative ?
look at that .
boy , if you &apos;re our cattle , and a cheetahs like a of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every single room , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so far , we were able to be able to raise the world wildlife fund in the ability to raise the very small programs to build more <unk> .
it &apos;s very important -- we invest in the money in the enlightenment of aids and hiv .
<unk> -- again , a <unk> under many in the world of the world -- are very valuable , they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
and we &apos;re hiding that price of huge winning giant .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> lead to food rights for food rights .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that were the known species .
that &apos;s like a <unk> of protein .
the science sees the world through the mind , quantitatively , what can be measured and described , but they &apos;re giving a frame of knowledge and discovery .
so , from a few cameras , after three weeks , a plan was a plan to have a <unk> .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
now , this wouldn &apos;t usually do a <unk> photographer , a photograph &apos;s like this , right ? but sometimes it must be able to show the dimensions .
here &apos;s how glaciers go back .
this is several cameras that have seen several cameras .
could india be the origin of the origin of the world , or a global center for innovation , just as it &apos;s been to a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
when we asked people in conversation with people in these <unk> , they were working on , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor if they were also a student .
the best hospitals in which the doctors would go for cancer , and in births , <unk> , heart disease , heart disease , for an <unk> <unk> , <unk> at 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently <unk> <unk> for four in the morning .
i said , i know a <unk> message when i see one .
every one in our society comes in the cancer with cancer -- if not personally , by a loved people , a family member , a colleague , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , inside of an nucleus .
we &apos;ve been used treating treating treating treating treating fields in the lab over the lab over 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect in all of them .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in six month , and it starts to start <unk> .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new client , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re deep up 15 feet deep , and harvest rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe and from your courtyard .
so water from 300 , 400 miles away , soon it looks like this .
somewhere runs a stream , or a <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english , we have <unk> and water .
and they have to go to get off .
these are the beautiful stairs we just saw on one of the images .
and <unk> is 27 percent down : 600,000 fewer people have been living in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they will get the jobs in penguin , which is the people from the <unk> and they get them to the way in the direction of industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries on the right , you see the <unk> . basically , every country with a <unk> of the country , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of us we say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew &apos;t so right .
buy african products .
but i think that a lot of a lot of a much more important problem with it is that these logic -- that we should drop ipods and not drop -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
so 500 people have been selected and they were selected and they were selected to visit the institution to visit the facility and so they &apos;re going to be blogging about it .
so now , citizens in the way to do is not necessarily change anything about by 2020 , because it &apos;s still the dictators that the agenda is the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : the internet is the internet of the most profound expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was hanging with younger people around us .
because for me , in this time , and in this <unk> , the question was , &quot; you want to be sex or drugs -- and we didn &apos;t take .
i was like paralyzed , people .
so , as indians , and i &apos;m also a lot of about the <unk> of the <unk> who &apos;s our country , and all the talk about india is a new <unk> , even the new superpower .
in other words , all of us tell us all sorts of stories about countries , regardless of whether they want to come to daylight or not .
but there was a little slow in our country at the time , it took about half an hour to a call <unk> .
it can &apos;t understand the conversation .
this can sometimes be an meritocratic consequences . ok .
and those of you who have the money here , you may be surprised to see how many <unk> on the <unk> are there that explain the <unk> .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of a little bit , and i found some startling statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
well , this title , this expression is coming from a critic , a early critic , and this is a passage that i just love , and i would like to read you .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it &apos;s like , a problem would have a problem : how about everything in the world are we going to get chimpanzees ?
that &apos;s the hardest part , which is not obvious , and so i &apos;ve picked it for the end .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s going to be .
i don &apos;t know why there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you .
i suspect in fact that the most fundamental reasons is probably known why we want to have new things very , very fast .
it &apos;s like that they look like this . they should like this .
bob mckim has another very different -- another version of this practice in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with the time : you can get a much better , much more creative results , if everyone is to the rules .
and suddenly , there was a productive conversation about design about a <unk> object .
they sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;m going to come back .
you know how it feels like all of these uncertainty , as long as you left back to the corridor , while the doctors are going to take care of a <unk> , and you wonder what &apos;s going on .
so , we would all feel secure , and they would have a good time , because we agreed to the rules and so agreed .
we do everything that leads to success , but then we have done it . we rebel and hear ourselves and hear all of what we succeeded .
i was faster , but as depressed .
i learned that success is not one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; i hope , for always , the last time in public .
he sure that everything fit together .
it took 900 people involved in part .
and the second thing is that people are obviously experiencing a actual relationship .
these are questions .
as you see in modern democracy democracies , the state of us not only to determine our self , but he does it also demands us .
it means that we meet our full potential as human beings .
so , these are the layers of questions that i wanted to conduct today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to the application when they design something ?
so i said , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> us to give you better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to be a fall in the fall .
he <unk> her in the right position , she <unk> her nose and flipper .
we learned the first surprise .
there had to be there to be some kind of <unk> to create a lot of power and the speed that we observe and the <unk> of the system .
so a load load is , a load cell , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> load cell with a crystal inside .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to make <unk> and go onto the load load cell .
a very , very <unk> solution to this particular problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful <unk> <unk> that &apos;s ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even <unk> , which is just to benefit from this is three-dimensional space .
now you see that -- he &apos;s just simply .
the submersible that was out last year , this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as <unk> , <unk> , -- please apologize the obvious example -- is not the right approach we need to choose .
basically , new york on the backs of the <unk> , our streets of their shells on their shells .
in these eight <unk> chamber , there are little <unk> that will be basically <unk> .
so , you walked around in london and was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally , snow built a map of the outbreak .
and that happens every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the <unk> temple .
and in this area of the amazon was discovered in 72 oil .
the other side of area is filtered in the torah where it &apos;s actually should stop osama . that &apos;s <unk> .
that was one of the big <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> . let me go and now show the pristine deep field .
but then you get to jupiter , and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that will be part of the beginning of the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so , the stuff that appears in the picture , dark matter .
when you saw this picture for the first time , you don &apos;t have a lot of it .
this simulation has been performed with 1,000 processors for a month , just to make this visible .
with <unk> , we &apos;re having a angular part of about this image of earth , which you can see complicated patterns of the earth .
and in the consequence we &apos;re stressed .
47 percent .
that &apos;s crazy . we do all the time we do in the same time .
i got into a vicious cycle . that led to a vicious pain and problems with joints , so i could almost hold anything .
so i asked myself , could you be creative , if you &apos;re going to take a creative person to the limitations ?
so this wasn &apos;t happening today today .
the fetus is <unk> by <unk> , as well as a <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> monitor the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , killed million <unk> , killed million <unk> , in the 40s they saw the nazis toward the nazis , the <unk> , burning , were arrested , were killed , were <unk> after germany .
it &apos;s the grief to get . &quot;
and as a <unk> , the notion of most of the most that we &apos;ve learned about us in the virtual world , and we could use our identity , to live in order to live a better life in the real world .
we used to be in a new way of being alone .
human relationships are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
because in the moment , in the people alone , even for a few seconds , you &apos;re going to <unk> , fear , you panicked , you &apos;re going to reach for a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently we didn &apos;t have any of the <unk> that some of our peers predicted , and pretty often -- pretty often , i felt that they had their predictions in a <unk> <unk> .
maybe my father &apos;s always read to us .
so i &apos;m going to leave you in silence , but really , he &apos;s really been .
and then i thought , i thought , i think , but i &apos;m missing the time to take a look at this .
although you &apos;re not going to lose fear of failure , if we &apos;ve given anything , because who can give people more and more than anything that he &apos;s going to be the .
if i call it because i never have an answer .
did i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials are used different types of heart disease for heart disease .
just last month , it has done us with this technology to show the building of human <unk> .
we can map them up and to take 360 degrees and analyze the kidney into all their <unk> properties , and then we can just take this information and then print by print .
i couldn &apos;t watch to school . i was just messy .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want . i want to do this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new sphere called the <unk> .
and in the <unk> , there were examples of the world -- from the choice of a presidents to the <unk> wikipedia and everything in between them -- the showed that the force of a lot .
third , <unk> , <unk> environmental issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want to cd ; i want to the music that she plays .
i hot joseph and a member of a member of kenya .
we have to <unk> our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
late night , i went home with batteries and ice .
together : did somebody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master &apos;s <unk> in moscow and work in full-time and to do this .
and that can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of between the <unk> volunteer for y , the <unk> of the <unk> work , the city of the city .
they have <unk> , tables and data .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re in the 18 minutes of mine who were given to be given to talk to speak here , between two and <unk> people who are going to be in the cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the building here have several stories .
these green things are <unk> .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have a political activity .
i couldn &apos;t even know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true true .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same <unk> , as i , helped me support their committed support , <unk> blissful in law .
they were working on only with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read every single cell .
but you know , i find it very lonely , to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books on the border , in the different <unk> countries , in the different <unk> countries : the u.k. , usa , america , usa , australia , and new zealand had to have all different <unk> of harry potter .
the <unk> . life has been doubled for more than doubled , and it &apos;s increasing increasing by a speed of five hours per day .
another last thing . do you want to be asking people like me , okay ?
secondly , the new age is a good news , because when the androids &apos;s work , we don &apos;t need to do more and it &apos;s <unk> us and <unk> .
the societal challenges of the societal challenges should be considered to be attention .
the economic playbook is surprising to be surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially in short sight .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with disruptive technologies , embedded in a kind of <unk> society and supported inequality instead of possibilities to support inequality .
in the course of years , i started increasingly feeling more comfortable with this perception of god .
some of have <unk> that we can &apos;t believe in a god , that &apos;s what you &apos;re sharing .
in the second , the line is &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the &quot; soul of the universe .
by the god in addiction . by my own <unk> <unk> .
one of the first things i started exploring was the story of the <unk> &quot; technology . &quot;
we &apos;ve not found any species that we &apos;ve been found as 40 years old , and the average age of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies have used to these new diet .
so this is a human race of energy and matter , the einstein &apos;s shown , and also the modern science of the <unk> is showing the entropy and information and matter all together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to plug your own plug to plug more electricity .
and what i mean is we &apos;re looking for you a new job .
a great development that has begun billions of years ago , moving around us and continues , and our choice is in the technology , is really in it , is really in the power of that , which is much more powerful than we .
and they said , &quot; well , we have 30 grade 30 to 40 students .
we cut all this , and found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it would look like , as we &apos;ve got somebody said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat at the tables , and they were waiting for .
there are a lot of <unk> . the only problem , especially for the adults who are working on the <unk> , which really didn &apos;t know what they were really done , that there was only a toilet .
the teachers we work -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
there &apos;s about 170 tutors with them to work with them , and so this has worked beautifully .
and right behind it -- there &apos;s usually a small chain -- right behind them , they would be taught as children .
there &apos;s also this <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re going to go in your <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s going to be his cousin .
so , he &apos;s writing an email , he &apos;ll ask you every question you can see .
i was this girl .
80 percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace means the end of the battle , and there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace is the peace building of schools and support jobs .
she sent her kids to school -- found a new home .
there is also one , the manual for complete idiots , did it know ?
on the cape cod there are <unk> roads , and we can all here here .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt bad about it .
so i went out of this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos is very good <unk> .
the school is the hardest thing , so it &apos;s number of a little bit of it .
in fact , in a peculiar <unk> about <unk> , which was above a window to be black , until the street was black <unk> , and this <unk> <unk> was there in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great <unk> of protei armstrong reminded that religion really understood nothing to believe in the way of doing it .
the <unk> has seen , geographically , the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it has exactly the same size like the united states , an area that &apos;s about equal to the size of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the world developed .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , the australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of all of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have through the presumption of that challenge .
now , before i show you a few images to preview , i want to point out to this beautiful detail of <unk> and design .
so , this is actually an extraordinary school in this particular .
we &apos;ve discussing with a keith &apos;s discussing with a keith <unk> , that many scientists are not tend to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear of being considered stupid <unk> .
so here &apos;s examples that you can actually print textiles , which is very interesting .
so that allows us to think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit .
we did the same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge that we had to ask as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces more than you can , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; <unk> 7 : a whole band of
and there are some employees in foundations that are called <unk> .
the idea of justice , which gives us on the lives and gives us a sense of what &apos;s really true in life , which is what we should do , social justice .
and as this is , he &apos;s like a <unk> during the <unk> .
so every week , the <unk> will come up . &quot; god , you &apos;ve got me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , a infection , or a surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> like this .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- the , frankly , frankly , in this kind of pain are not very effective .
now , you get a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was in 1908 . it &apos;s nothing .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back of the back of the back of the back of all . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa launched a probe called deep impact , which is a -- which is a part of themselves in the heart of a comet .
these are bright guys -- men and women -- astronauts like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and we &apos;re that we can have a <unk> and choose , and so that we can change our future .
and i led to <unk> , the only independent , to be right , the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that <unk> survival and a great company would be , if <unk> would be gone , which was going to be right .
and at the end of the meeting he says , well , it &apos;s not going to work , you will never see your money again , but my foundation will be 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , that -- that &apos;s all right , we &apos;re going to make your business business with what they actually made .
look at the east and <unk> of our work and we went to russia .
after a while we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve evolved the idea of building bonds to the <unk> press .
and in that way , you include the financing , so that there is no <unk> , no blind more , the running around .
so , why does it work ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some of the one theory is called a theory of everything .
one simple example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like a divided through the <unk> of the <unk> between each other objects objects .
the more symmetry you have , the better message , and elegance theory .
one thing that he thought about the most of us as granted , but at that time , that wasn &apos;t .
it doesn &apos;t <unk> the importance of the public knowledge that they follow <unk> laws and accidents .
but he read in every time he had , books .
by that ambition , he came back to the <unk> .
but when he was just to put his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf and coughing , because he &apos;d just been <unk> on the morning .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i got , the more i understand what was an incredible privilege of being in this aging lion as many hours .
and so , as lincoln was telling the story , all after the war after the war .
i asked my father to tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
and what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love of history that allows me to spend a life in the past .
he had the temple <unk> and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is evidence that the jews &apos; in babylon , after all the years that she sat in babylon of the rivers , and in the memory of jerusalem that these jews go home .
all those will have seen by cyrus respects .
the <unk> cylinder is from the priests of the great <unk> of babylon , marduk .
you all know what happened .
so to see this object in tehran , thousands of the living in the living jews to tehran .
some of knowledge more about the conditions of living conditions , but they think they &apos;re a <unk> <unk> .
the newly <unk> babies send in the first few hours , but their needs not hit and eventually they learned to try and get <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and start in the air , like everybody else .
one study shows that <unk> 10 percent of a <unk> cost , whereas <unk> costs about 30 percent .
and that was me , because i was spent almost my whole life in a camera .
you know , you &apos;re pretty quickly what to do to find a answer .
there were <unk> people -- most of them and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course , he never came out . the explanation has been happening .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it has done to bring us into the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and to his ability to work , etc . , etc . -- and they were really going to be reality .
we connect with <unk> -- i &apos;ve met <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; at the london of 2012 , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about your <unk> , to go to your business .
the biggest brains of the world should be able to be cognitively .
i <unk> the literature after the origin of this number , but i couldn &apos;t find them .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , that matches exactly what our ancestors probably invented a million years ago when they discovered the cooking .
very simple approaches to the <unk> conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but once the struggle with the fight , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to the physical rehabilitation .
he was a kid , his son , red in the face of a <unk> , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and i was talking to my bosses in the headquarters and i told you -- i &apos;m told you -- i said , &quot; look , we start with a few hours a day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of the <unk> began to fight .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it about ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we need to raise the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a <unk> .
and this hospital would have been able to be able to afford to be able to have .
why ? because the way i had was banned .
but i learned something more about when that , that , the leaders -- the the economy of the economy -- incredibly bad decisions , which had been made our economy for a long before the breakdown .
because i knew that the state of the african continent had been to be the state of the african continent and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience i &apos;d been at swarthmore to africa .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment where a great society can level-up within a generation .
you will notice that he &apos;s got the <unk> yellow ball -- the sun that we draw as kids .
in fact , that &apos;s something that we have half of them , more than half , not being familiar .
32 pills <unk> .
i guess . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages that you &apos;re doing ?
because , in the bottom , the sponsors love it , and so he &apos;s going to watch it all the time .
a professional <unk> who talks about the dead , they didn &apos;t get me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to have to have some quick of you , how to <unk> <unk> and community leaders to do something .
thank you .
so all the hospital is just a generator for a generator .
it has to give something better . &quot;
but so , the user can control whether it &apos;s just electricity , because they can control the <unk> on the base , how much percent oxygen you give their patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the effective and the safest device that we can do .
the different species of writing in africa , the first was <unk> , like the scripture <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> society of the <unk> society of the <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , as a <unk> named john <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , which discovered in 1800 to 1900 a.d. <unk> <unk> , centuries before mesopotamia .
almost a fifth of greenhouse gases from livestock -- that &apos;s more than the transport .
not bad .
i like animals , and the <unk> of <unk> and animals on the assembly assembly of the assembly assembly assembly assembly assembly .
<unk> was a <unk> of a french matter .
a picture of <unk> would be even better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t really bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would argue that maybe that maybe not so bad .
about a year , about a year , i asked myself a question : why am i know , although i know , i know , not a vegetarian ? &quot;
on the weekend , you have the choice .
you can make a picture with an iphone and all the names , even though it makes mistakes even even mistakes .
she &apos;s got distracted . he &apos;s got the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be thinking about it , more about the interest , if the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big artwork .
human nature should have to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical level in the <unk> of the -- is that they &apos;re intrinsically valuable .
it could be more complicated to people , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it <unk> to play with this forces ?
and so i knew that i need to do something to the remote control .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there is <unk> , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of liquid .
and so i think that they can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and <unk> the individual slices , during the messenger in the hallway and the <unk> of the corridor .
i was safe to get 20 , before i first went to an art museum .
i thought , okay , you have some criteria like you want to choose the work .
it &apos;s not photoshop photoshop .
they were interested in creating unprecedented <unk> , and they needed money for it , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave , and he did this , it was hilarious -- the attention that we got .
and she describes how the <unk> thing is , it &apos;s like that they &apos;re like about because of the <unk> fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s origami with origami . so on .
people used mathematics principles on the art of understanding the underlying intelligence .
or they &apos;re taking it up on the top and you &apos;re going to put 50 stars on a flag with a <unk> .
how would you make a flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules that you put circles , you put around the <unk> of the lines that make the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but , if you want to make it bigger , you could need origami .
and that doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re going to space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> state in the state of washington to a much more time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about hours of hours .
and so , i want to talk about it because if we don &apos;t acknowledge it , this is actually very painful .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , and the women start to <unk> the job market , and it goes to the day of the day .
you were instruction .
because i &apos;m going to write about all the book , i &apos;m still , and i don &apos;t have an answer .
and that was very daunting .
because we don &apos;t really processed this information , they come back to us in the form of culture , in this weird and <unk> way you can see that bats change .
there is no man or no woman who sits in the middle and the cable is to categorize the cord .
in the way the personal income on a scale that has been given to consider inflation in this time , in this time , has nearly tripled .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you need to do about 60 bits per second .
so , it &apos;s going to happen , so in the last book of mine , &quot; good business &quot; i interviewed some ceo who were used to be very successful and very ethical <unk> , with great social contagion , with great social activism .
now , control is a safe thing , because you feel it , but not a very special thing .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own importance of what home , they had their importance for community , and even for <unk> , which was born by birth to <unk> , and they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond that .
more people are in the future or present , as well as in the past .
i went down into the room where i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home at home ?
there was a huge gap between the existing billion countries between the industrialized world , and two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap more .
and let me show why , by talking to the <unk> , digital technology .
the survival of children is the new green .
and again , they were better than us , &quot; your brits and your mortality mortality in heart is shocking . &quot;
but if you &apos;re people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with <unk> , they were growing up , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice that can &apos;t produce .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
could you be equally good at the equator in summer .
certainly many of progress , many of life life .
this is even real photography , right , the <unk> shows that the limb is <unk> within a <unk> .
and here on the right , you see , what six months later , the technically is going to be <unk> .
a <unk> is made of two different types of cell types .
we then put it back into this oven-like device .
even more complex organs , with each other the complex solid solid organs , the high <unk> , the high <unk> , with every lot of <unk> <unk> organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is even in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not chipped apart and not <unk> tumors .
we need only five seconds .
for every problem there , someone would have an idea .
so , i &apos;m a little bit of panic that i &apos;m in <unk> , different than all of the <unk> and sugar that i had -- but this is an entrepreneur really really .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a <unk> .
i went off door door to door and sold <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there is a recession .
and you would make these chairs .
it &apos;s pointless . &quot; you need to find a way to get faster .
i sold copious amounts of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the ability to find other things , and they learn the ability to the <unk> , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go into a restaurant and bad , they show you how bad <unk> .
these young , <unk> .
the development of the students today is , all the interest to throw out of the board .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> , the majority of our students .
the values of the past are also <unk> . that &apos;s going to be a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy of the principles , not the <unk> .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should do , if we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980 &apos;s 1980 -- what &apos;s about the church , you go to the church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe that .
and that doesn &apos;t just do it just to another result , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
entirely different .
in fact , that &apos;s not a right organization , but sure -- let &apos;s just end up -- creative commons offers a simple way to put it with the liberties that you &apos;re going to leave you with .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often happened .
he told me that he &apos;s the <unk> <unk> and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to show you through this process and show you how this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general , we were happy .
i survived only so that we understand ourselves right .
i &apos;m going to ask people all the time : &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way , how microbes can expand is through humans , and architects are like <unk> , to the architects , to the way together to stimulate the human interaction , to promote the data , to promote the way of the way of ideas in clinic and the offices .
imagine a design of design , for example , the microbes on the plane or a telephone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by <unk> .
and greenpeace was meant to the <unk> , and a way to do that , it was a <unk> <unk> in it , one of those humpback whales whales .
in 78 percent of voices . to give you an idea of the <unk> defeat : <unk> 2 in the <unk> , only three percent .
and the final message i want to tell you is : you can be pretty successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what &apos;s a big privilege of being today today .
this is the school that was built with community community .
something we have in gando , <unk> .
just like this .
good morning . magic is a good way to be ahead of the <unk> of the world that the science tomorrow is really going to really become .
there is the color of red and color black , they &apos;re going to be moving from the winds from day .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good slate .
that &apos;s an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t have a country like china , the civilization-state , on the ground of a civilization , a system .
and the reason for this is , first , the state in china is a very special -- very special , and it has a very special level of <unk> , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was in 72 miles , <unk> beijing with <unk> and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the <unk> -- the position of <unk> rapidly <unk> -- or the <unk> position .
he goes down to a <unk> in the suburb , and the cars drive below .
red stretches of blue is covered green = green = <unk> <unk> , the <unk> gyrus is suffused with ...
and the first song was in english , the second was in chinese .
she was perfectly wrong .
i was a graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , the city was used as canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that you would be <unk> to the picture next to another .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a <unk> face -- that &apos;s a funny face , right ? &quot;
most of the places i went to , i decided to go to the media .
i took more and more photos , and we started the project .
are you an ngo ? are you about media ? &quot;
so the roofs were the roofs , a woman , &quot; now , god can see me . &quot;
because that &apos;s a huge part of it . there is layers behind every single photograph .
but you basically took a promise to me .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
so if i think about the networking , and what you &apos;re driving , why it &apos;s happening now , i think there are some of the things i &apos;d like to give you as a <unk> .
they &apos;ve unleashed a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it challenges for participation . cities have been welcomed with participation .
it &apos;s very affordable , and it &apos;s very <unk> . &quot;
the last 40 years were extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
that would be a bit of <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s vital that at ted ideas , ideas , about the way we think about , and to make sure that this is a particularly proper <unk> century , and not one of <unk> and <unk> .
my family &apos;s boring academics who are concerned about this , <unk> <unk> for our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he would be crazy , but something that was really on .
i was sitting , like you here , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra , my career , my career , it has been a lot of success .
i started exploring the <unk> of human psyche .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s been very exciting here at ted 2006 , here at ted 2006 , and actually , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous when you fall down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , you remember ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents found this is important for their inner .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s kind of taking things apart from that i have <unk> .
the body has higher density than water , at least 95 percent of the body comes from itself .
and this is going to be very far .
i asked him what that means .
and from this point , you can , if you want to get some languages , and take them out each other .
and she looked up to me and said , &quot; well , it &apos;s better .
i think they &apos;re going to tell me that they look very well .
and so far as well as we &apos;ve done tests with 50,000 students , so about a half a dozen schools , my readers , the way .
we found out -- and we were pretty much wrong with a lot of things , and then we find them -- but we found that the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a small introduction to the <unk>
and finally , the only person , the classroom , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there is the head , men on horses and with <unk> .
goliath is low prey . he &apos;s not a chance .
so goliath is to be more than more than the time of time , and usually it is a explanation for it when someone is so far outside the norm .
and i think that there is a very important thing for us all .
and it turns out that we &apos;re covered by a <unk> , and these microbes are often good at the time , instead of murder .
they all have microbes <unk> and the ileum in the recipient .
most of the pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , they have a or two , maybe five species , and the human community has tens of thousands of species .
we need a <unk> for the microbes that live in and in humans , so we can understand what they &apos;re doing to our lives .
very many people think about the internet is very <unk> , but for us , it &apos;s global global . we have a lot of languages .
when you saw him a ridiculous change on the page of me , they thought they were just thought that all of all of the things were just in <unk> .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we &apos;re not talking about truth and objectivity .
and we &apos;ve over 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not perfect rule , but it &apos;s actually enough to start .
and i always say , you &apos;re always saying that she &apos;s the only person that actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , that &apos;s why ...
it seems like most textbooks that are used to be used for the education of our children , from nature .
in the jungle in guatemala , in <unk> , there &apos;s a temple .
a not known american indians in <unk> &apos;s told it in <unk> &apos;s a missionary in the year , and here &apos;s it .
it &apos;s actually far under your cognitive <unk> .
we also found activity in the other <unk> -- in <unk> , which is associated with computation and loss .
i have a friend of mine who &apos;s a terrible <unk> process .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn each other , and we think our look &quot; heritage &quot; and we &apos;re talking about .
so , the tools like , knife , <unk> , <unk> , i had kicked in a towel .
i had been looking for long , and i had never been looking for me .
in some <unk> , they &apos;re making a <unk> , about sponges to the <unk> .
so dolphins can start with the <unk> and start tickle .
look at how they partner with your partner and the other <unk> .
we were very quickly , that , there are free dolphins just to depend on a keyboard .
this dolphin is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; because it &apos;s about 12 <unk> <unk> .
but as we decode their natural sounds , we also plan to bring this back into the system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially when you &apos;re in the <unk> , you have to fly .
yr : i just try to be fit .
i &apos;ve been used in the last 15 years , maybe it &apos;s been used for 20 times -- never with this kind of wing , but at the beginning .
that &apos;s what we don &apos;t tell .
but it was up to <unk> and full of <unk> .
so wondered , as well as i think what they saw is to explain by the invisible powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution since the our knowledge of the physical world since our knowledge of the physical world , and how we can adjust to our needs , <unk> in the growing .
by the way , why do we do that ?
it &apos;s based on assumptions ; our in the bible . &quot;
there is something like a <unk> story .
and only if one explanation is good , it &apos;s also important to you check .

please raise your hand as an atheist .
the best definition of <unk> i know -- she &apos;s explains so much -- comes from <unk> gary .
it makes us very , very old <unk> <unk> .
but look at the other three lines of them .
are it just the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
she continued upward and keep on .
and they say , &quot; hold out of the laws of my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of <unk> to the right , <unk> is the liberal god -- and both of them work together .
and so the answer is , i think , this passionate devotion to the truth and try and turn them into a better future for us all .
but if you &apos;re responding , a lot of other people are in the neighborhood who are innocent , but they could be hurt -- the military doesn &apos;t want to talk about <unk> .
we look at something different , &quot; and realized that the situations actually were very comparable .
is someone a commandment of how often , as you think how did it be introduced , how often the police were in the police were in the police were in the <unk> ?
there were only a few people who were shot in this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this as if this is the most <unk> way to deal with it .
and if you &apos;re going to use them , people will give them , but they should not cause any more likely damage . &quot;
we have makers from organizing to our maker &apos;s maker .
<unk> , <unk> bass , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved to other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we have to bring that in the schools , or in the communities , many ways -- the ability to build the world to shape and new to shape .
there is the glamour of physics .
and indeed , we see these <unk> photos of stars all the time -- you call them <unk> .
you don &apos;t look about a way , but you have to be mentally imagine your world .
stairs , the <unk> winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always mediated the illusion that if you buy this light , you can be living in a world without wires .
the perfect <unk> -- symbolizes the perfect chain , with the perfect <unk> .
because glamour can be very <unk> and deceptively .
but i also knew how hard they worked for all week .
i did a few stranger .
i heard women who were discarded in their beds , or <unk> in their <unk> , like dead left behind in lots of a parking parking and in their kitchens .
then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my friend was made this big bowl , and i asked her , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
it was friends for me , and a lovely sister for me .
because we all are so bad <unk> to experience the inner experience of our human beings and their secret intentions . &quot;
kids need a long time to do it until they master the system .
rs : -- now joshua &apos;s going on to drink a little bit .
rs : so , should ivan get trouble ?
and you &apos;re in your friend of your friend .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
please tell me that they don &apos;t even <unk> when , say , the pentagon is called the pentagon .
but why does you feel something about ?
and it was , you know , it &apos;s already a course of <unk> .
and second , it &apos;s possible to be able to slow down , to slow down ?
they want to be back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are among the six <unk> nations in the world and work hours where the average americans would cry .
but the new idea that the revolutionary idea of the <unk> is that it &apos;s also like &quot; good slow . &quot;
i &apos;m sure the <unk> of the <unk> task on my <unk> , it was <unk> me before they were so slowly and i was going to be done .
and so it took all its start , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on a island ; a part of it needs to stay on the shore because we &apos;re not going to turn from the community . &quot;
i worked months and months and i didn &apos;t work with it because i felt that people who came from the historic museum already , and when you can see a museum of information , you would not process that anymore .
when i flew home , the <unk> was planned .
but you can see the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe safdie : the
and when christian was a grade -- game , for example .
so in jazz , the <unk> is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about what i &apos;m talking about , or something like this .
am i &apos;m going ? exist ?
they had to get a lot of <unk> to come here .
in summer , india is becoming extremely hot .
and the adult animal that comes after that , it &apos;s another one or two months .
now , i didn &apos;t know , but i know it today . these are hundreds of <unk> .
and that made me a little bit curious . i &apos;m going to hear you here , because i &apos;m going to ask you , and here are a lot of people who have been -- of course -- people who spent their childhood here .
so , next was i was going to hit me .
october , november , december . that &apos;s not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , they lay your eggs at the time of the <unk> rains during the <unk> .
it &apos;s just the last week , it <unk> . the <unk> has begun and now it raining there .
it &apos;s a pretty incredible <unk> .
incredible . this is the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> ever . a pretty incredible journey .
i made out of my life .
and everybody thought , i would be good . but in the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what happened to <unk> ? &quot;
so , in the night i looked at them and i asked them , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
next -- oh , paying attention . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done all of this , what is it , you know , i &apos;ve talked about the <unk> and other things , but what is going to do ?
my latest tedtalk , about seven years ago .
and carl norden really has really cracked the code .
whenever the norden bombsight is brought to a plane , it &apos;s accompanied by a row of <unk> guards .
the chemical plant <unk> on over three square miles .
after the war was a <unk> review -- so it was a <unk> -- as it &apos;s the army , the force force always doing -- and they asked the question : how many <unk> did we actually actually destroyed ?
i &apos;ve described the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city , or a <unk> , this diversity of human species is in amazing ways .
we wonder about the human ancestry .
but what data is the statements ?
imagine , you &apos;d have to <unk> it .
it was a african , which is based on the global diversity of <unk> .
the sahara was much more than today .
the people who are in the killing of animals , they were brought in the <unk> , moved to north , and about 80,000 years ago , about 80,000 years ago , in the middle east , about the middle east , in a rare <unk> stage of the sahara .
the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deeply in our heart that the universe is not moving from mush to complexity .
so we go .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a one-thousandth of a percentage than the red areas .
and so on the smaller distances as gravity works , what explains why they are , and i grew up as a bit of the stars and planets .
you &apos;re familiar with the fossil dna of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s the talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it &apos;s going to be insurance .
and then they have to decide how they invest in your 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard of a <unk> .
at least a wonderful trial has predicted the world .
but if you get afforded , you cross the box if you don &apos;t want to donate the fuel .
the other group is going to be taken two apples .
even more tomorrow , it &apos;s just doing .
that &apos;s just an example .
it &apos;s a song about a called <unk> , an creature that mimics an nature , again , that is an authentic .
hey who &apos;s because there ?
thank you .
you know too much influence on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they did ? they sent her raleigh with walter raleigh to separate their human part of the divine part .
<unk> you a child ?
elizabeth : <unk> you out ! <unk> you out ! <unk> you out !
i went to a friend of mine , and he &apos;d been waiting for his <unk> in <unk> hill in the 20th floor , a really rich neighborhood in mumbai .
it &apos;s a contradiction .
we lived from less than a dollar dollar day -- about 15 years .
and you &apos;ve got to use nuts from rainforests to show that forests are worth more value than the <unk> . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t be a person who says it says it &apos;s . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if you &apos;re all going to be able to be sustainable at a single planet , how can we achieve this ?
coke needs to work with pepsi .
this is nine of them .
at the end , we think 60 percent of the world &apos;s world &apos;s right and 25 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they also buy the carbon dioxide in the trees , to the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which is going to be in europe .
so that &apos;s going to be interrupted by the brain and spinal cord ; it leads to a whole full and sustained paralysis of the <unk> .
after a few years , we &apos;ve managed to develop a electrochemical <unk> , which is the nervous system of the spinal cord in a single state .
we &apos;ve been working on 10 years working on this target .
after a few weeks , we put a programmable pump to inject a programmable pump directly into the spinal cord .
and i was a kid of the class class .
he was talking about the world as she is &quot; and the world , as it should . &quot;
and by doing that , these women are made a lot of hurdles out of the way .
in the white house , and the desk he is sitting in the white house , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and the last day , the woman who got to take care of everything , and we talked about , and so they got to me , &quot; would you sing me to me ? &quot;
for this <unk> , a <unk> of the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneous , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet needs the internet and instructions .
one of the most popular sites in the world that is run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing to have done youtube or google to have to do .
and today wikipedia is so <unk> that you can actually find them on the maps of restaurants in china .
and that &apos;s what wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
why ? there is a <unk> of <unk> .
the world didn &apos;t ended in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the impact of the ecosystem in some countries are very , very strong in some countries .
all of this costs money .
and it was done a lot of effort to give students and from socially weak families to give the same opportunities .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in bureaucratic <unk> teachers are left in the classroom alone , and they have a lot of <unk> .
some people argue that the change of the <unk> is resembles the change of the <unk> .
but if you look at the problem of this perspective , you see what &apos;s happening in the last 60 years .
and i walked out the whole morning about 15 kilometers to the <unk> .
so , this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could also do that with telephones .
so a business of business .
&quot; the government needs to offer economically accountable services . &quot;
it was a long ago ago , a long time ago when i was 24 years at the time in st. john &apos;s medical college at the time .
and you can see my map if i <unk> them here .
and i &apos;m bringing a invention with .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan is about a time of war , with low life expectancy .
and they decided to invest in health and education , but also began to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. , went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble bubble .
will it really accept countries that have really accept the entirely entirely transformed global global economy , and the power shifts of where they &apos;ve been in the last 50 to 150 years , back to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that explains the presence of all the mass .
and now , you give you the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s happening in the <unk> .
they move away from each other because the space is going to be bigger .
so , as a stack of things like stack -- their <unk> , how many of you are there as a function of time -- can we be in experience , in the way that dark matter of the way to compete to create structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy man banjo boys : <unk> bluegrass <unk> ...
so , recycling and reusing are <unk> .
marc <unk> : 1.3 million reasons to invent the <unk> .
and in fact , this change was <unk> in gay men in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see that the spread of prevalence .
it makes a very similar <unk> .
but openness and connection has a price if we think about diseases . this shouldn &apos;t be surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> : even at the time of the <unk> statistics in africa is to a surprising note : all of our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated because i watched this kind of <unk> italian <unk> <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; because he was the beginning , but every time he was going into a tunnel , he built a <unk> , and the <unk> came out of the tunnel , it always had a kind of <unk> .
this hump would be on the water like a magnet .
then we wonder why the membrane is congested and why it takes so much electricity .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> in a material .
in <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , we work with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine benyus : biomimicry &apos;s <unk>
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , no boys .
you can &apos;t do it against it .
it will never happen again , because it was once again and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray to us . &quot;
this was a <unk> for over 1,000 prisoners in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we made a few years later , a kind of a captcha .
basically , you start using it by a old book .
the number of sides of the parts of the <unk> is actually so high that the number of the words that we &apos;re digitize a day , very large .
some of them are more funny .
we &apos;ve been <unk> the web in multiple languages .
then my favorite question is the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a valve .
but what may be more surprising to the translations we get from the <unk> , even if you &apos;re just a few of the translations of the who we are , as well as the need to <unk> , and that &apos;s very surprising .
because people learn to do value , they don &apos;t have to pay for money , they pay for their time .
the water interconnected , the company , does that what they really can do .
<unk> to change in active participation , everything else is normal .
and zipcar offers a very appealing , <unk> service , the fabulous thing works .
in aristotle , happiness was the highest good job , the goal to everything else .
maybe these people may be right . his thought is , maybe not good .
ten percent of the time , the thoughts -- -- in sex .
i was played by violent africans , the african terrorists .
well , the first <unk> didn &apos;t have a explicit fight -- so it had no one absolute majority -- so the election was ongoing in a second round three weeks later .
now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla , and i &apos;ve learned surfing .
the people in the 17th century , not really much how we know that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we breathe it from a certain reason .
and so charles , i &apos;m going to give money to give you a building , and you can meet you there , but talk there , please don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody would have a little bit of the mind that this way .
just to see what would happen if you stick the two together .
so i &apos;m something that &apos;s not personally .
if you &apos;re going to become rich today , entrepreneurs .
they say if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t matter -- it doesn &apos;t matter at all . we &apos;re measuring it for 20 years , and it &apos;s not going to be very careful .
biochemist mullis mullis : the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century and <unk> the curiosity and <unk> the curiosity and <unk> the curiosity and <unk> the curiosity and care of all their forms .
i wanted to represent a simple way of living body , which is these <unk> , polluted spaces .
&quot; <unk> city , &quot; is a nickname for new york and <unk> , which is the <unk> and <unk> that emerges from the feeling of <unk> in a urban environment .
i love it , traveling , and berlin is a of my <unk> .
and all the time i have , i don &apos;t have a single rat at any of these places , until recently , when i was in the united states .
the first question is , and maybe you write it on , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or a virtual leaf in your head , and you can try and try this .
and we &apos;re going to do , &quot; we &apos;re the best <unk> in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- you &apos;re nodding , they &apos;re in , &quot; hmm , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the hardest problems is when people have already have a notion of how it works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change that .
and as an expert in inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who are different between the organic , living world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , he <unk> , <unk> , growing in a way .
we actually have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin even himself in a letter to a colleague who may probably have come out somewhere in a warm little pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe different .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally , thousands of really large <unk> molecules , in the same size of the dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in view .
we want to transplant it in the environment , and we want to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can build inorganic biology , and it can bring matter to <unk> , then , then that &apos;s actually defined life .
there &apos;s another reason that i like this <unk> : every single thing is .
and they &apos;re highly professional to the professional interviewer that would sit for an hour of an woman and they ask them to their <unk> .
i was sitting on friday in friday , and i could see how the mortality mortality in this morning was <unk> down .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of them .
as you can see , this doesn &apos;t make sense a average of a improvement that wasn &apos;t really , and that very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about that much .
they were high , or very high , child mortality and the families were very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s also a promise .
whatever remains more value for money .
yes , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he said , &quot; well , &quot; the <unk> is in question .
all the time was a border .
and <unk> , i think , to me , the world will make us move forward , is not just a difference , not just for a few , but for everybody .
... above the knee , yeah , that &apos;s a difficult ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody needs , but not everybody greed .
and <unk> die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific research research -- 40 labs -- when two <unk> hadn &apos;t speak together , i built teams .
they &apos;ve been now , and now i have apps in the app .
it &apos;s about to perfect and to perfect and to perfect and to make an old old thing .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more <unk> .
because of this reactor , because there &apos;s not under high pressure and chemical isn &apos;t so reactive , that the <unk> is not to leave the reactor .
i believe that the reactor that i designed here is a innovative resource source , the great scientific projects can be <unk> and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move ourselves to a <unk> , where the experience is the actual product .
there is a manufacturer of the <unk> to make the <unk> that they go in the woods .
at the end of a long <unk> advice he gives his son <unk> , he says this : &quot; is <unk> against you .
usually you &apos;re not going on in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk much out outside in this city .
they &apos;re going to be wrong as <unk> -- by making traits that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very introverted , and i was staying for myself alone .
and then it just took me to start to start at a point and then to build it up to the end .
so i built it out of concrete , because it &apos;s really no matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , the most important thing is , because i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
so 25 days : the <unk> <unk> came up to 32 days : poor and hands , and then , over 36 days , the primitive spine starts to train in the <unk> of the time , in the fetus , the fetus .
the complexity , in a single system , again beyond any understanding of any understanding of the existing mathematics .
because apparently , this <unk> <unk> is not <unk> in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
i sent a colleague of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum , and i said , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- where matter and chemical elements in the universe and <unk> .
because , can you imagine that all of the <unk> ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just going to be , and say , &quot; so , we &apos;re going to work on . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see <unk> , and oxygen , then , i think we have the perfect session in e.t.
i mean , &quot; really ? &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you : it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m very easy to <unk> , but that &apos;s another talk .
so that led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what is you going to feel vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you didn &apos;t right . hold up .
we do so , as if we have , no effects on other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , the <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so if we think of thinking , you can use to use to make systematic improvement , then we think about how to be useful to our own care and self-awareness and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , we have to find a new access to health care .
so steven divides his story . but it &apos;s not alone .
here is why people pray .
i also implant this <unk> implant , and this was the only <unk> that we were available online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you haven &apos;t have data , which is not going to scientific methods .
this is the curve over the <unk> .
but my brother don &apos;t , with him , it was too .
if we went from here from the <unk> , we would be able to do something that 300 feet long , the 300 feet long , 28 miles wide , 28 miles wide .
to change the state , you only need two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there is a fascinating solution that we call the <unk> .
hence , these are <unk> , networks are <unk> biological systems .
and it also has implications to systemic risk .
so we could put every single <unk> in any of them .
we see the emergence of the <unk> and <unk> programs that focuses on the way we understand the way of the complexity of the complexity of the complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we were getting 500 of these <unk> .
without human <unk> .
so we were up on our <unk> .
and this graph is not even something that data is invented .
and my brain starts very quickly to think that this is a <unk> representation of the world in the world .
because this question is assuming that our external world can predict our <unk> , but the truth is that i can predict only 10 percent of the <unk> of a person if i &apos;m going to predict all the external world .
and this is made of two reasons , scientifically , and wrong .
we &apos;re moving people to do when you open your <unk> , an positive email , or the <unk> of somebody in your social environment .
weightfully too -- a <unk> , you understand -- my father was the <unk> man in the world .
and so i went . i went to mit .
they said , &quot; make it stop .
they take a huge disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media <unk> in tokyo .
listen ? how cows ? this is 4 a.m. this morning .
so there &apos;s all of these things , but most of love i &apos;m trying to find the world , taste .
and i &apos;ve been taking this with passion .
their culture comes in school , and i want to see how we can overcome this problem .
so that makes it nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to school , who there are no boys .
and on little moments in my life .
or mothers , the cubs were brought to girls ?
we need to change the posture of elementary school in elementary school .
and you think that you think that &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s see where we &apos;re going to be a hypothesis .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can give us &quot; why &quot; <unk> evidence can be able to nature .
i &apos;m going to try and i &apos;m trying to be able to the end , and i &apos;m also excited about whether it works .
and that was really a really important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really really affect the object .
we created a newspaper for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s radio by radio with my ipad , and this is a software that &apos;s on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , so i &apos;m so <unk> so that people react in the glass , when you get it up .
i &apos;m going to be in a man &apos;s middle-aged , and then in an old man .
<unk> extra allowed to do .
radio : what do you think ?
just fold the wings together and drive them on .
so , i &apos;m asking a different question .
and he had a royal <unk> , with <unk> , who had been reporting , and night , but with the secret instruction , it doesn &apos;t particularly well to <unk> .
because they found that the human behavior is more likely to behave .
but yet we have to create a clear <unk> <unk> where you can create this kind of value . and it &apos;s also a lot of fair .

but couldn &apos;t be done for this point of the <unk> more ?
they were <unk> by governments , and they were <unk> and in many cases they have them .

it helps us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and in fact , this insect is .
i &apos;d smell like one of someone else .
it warms up not only 43 to 44 degrees fahrenheit for about two days for about two days , but it &apos;s holding a constant .
but the contrast is going to be like this . you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the background .
here , the americans of the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
and she started to tell me about that , and all the parents here are going to see the <unk> .
i have a <unk> story .
our lives is defined by data , and the presentation of this data is a chance to create fantastic interfaces for us to tell the great stories .
i also put a look at the different <unk> of the different <unk> , where you can choose what you want to point out of data .
it &apos;s a <unk> man who is in the box and controlled with this <unk> .
a <unk> of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a <unk> of 68 cents .
and in the reason , you can -- what you can see on the left side is the <unk> , and on the right side , you &apos;ve been interpreted by 16 people who had no idea what they do .
the <unk> bell : patent , <unk> ... aaron <unk> : and we took all those individual pieces and <unk> them into another mechanical turk .
but we knew that we were in any case of the right person to make us and to build it and build something .
and it &apos;s all of the individual <unk> people who submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made some of images , <unk> , and put them in <unk> .
so a <unk> consequence of that is that you &apos;re always seeing a part of his image , and it leads to a very free <unk> .
and sometimes i have a emotional reaction to the news , like the earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers that we &apos;re doing , and what we present the world as our identity .
another <unk> is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it may be easier than ever before , a good living .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly <unk> .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , when you met someone who was very poor , you &apos;d be called a <unk> , literally , somebody who was lucky , the destiny , the destiny was a <unk> .
and that &apos;s going to be the youngest court with the angels and <unk> , and the sky is open .
i told you the action of honeybee <unk> .
what i think , really , i think , really is success and failure .
we should make sure that it &apos;s our ones that we &apos;re really the creators of our own <unk> .
alain de botton : a <unk> , <unk> <unk>
if you train for these sport , you smile .
you know , you &apos;re floating goggles with <unk> goggles , and you &apos;re going 60 trains a minute , you &apos;re never really looking at something you don &apos;t see .
they &apos;re in the liquid <unk> .
my breath is down to three <unk> .
and the ones should worry about me , i don &apos;t do it .
i swam in this thing .
it &apos;s the only <unk> that i &apos;m interested in .
that &apos;s already today .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly <unk> <unk> , like today , you know , many of these things are special <unk> , because they &apos;re not so well integrated .
many of you have the phillips direct life .
this is a very important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go to the way of sleep .
so we can change medicine in the <unk> , in all ages , by <unk> or <unk> kids to the seniors ; the whole spectrum of the disease -- i hope i &apos;m hoping to give you a sense of that -- around the globe .
so , i hope , i believe you -- the effects of the most prolific are enormously and the effects of diseases are also so much about the same of these different diseases and more .
how do we create stable societies ? longevity .
and in novel , a particular called alvin , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and the whole system .
and so there &apos;s no <unk> .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
steam broccoli should be faster .
maybe you may wonder how we make these <unk> .
our is the only cookbook to the world , in the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the finished hamburger .
a talk about how to have a talk about surgical robots , and i think about surgery .
and surgeons were more businessmen than doctors .
but eventually , the one is also .
they had to give up their intuitive movements to the instrumentation .
i &apos;ve been told you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you can see how it comes out to do something useful at all , that &apos;s not so much .
and we don &apos;t even have to have to have on that <unk> .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we have not only shown that bacteria can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> and take the <unk> of the risks that allows us to make the <unk> discoveries .
the film we &apos;re going to see is , they &apos;re made for the <unk> in new york .
i &apos;m not there .
it continued to do . they always always tried things better .
they don &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house . &quot;
i think in my family , we had very much luck . because we &apos;ve learned design backwards .
dusk , very good !
ed : and then <unk> row is a historical <unk> , and in the <unk> history , the paris in paris , has been taken in the beginning where the message has stood .
so , you see this chair ? the orange orange ? this is the <unk> <unk> .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to get to .
it was <unk> of outrage , they were full of speculation . they were <unk> . no sound information .
one of them is known : the explosion of explosion , the world population has been returned by two of two of five billion people in the last 50 years .
<unk> <unk> : nice here .
you see the lines , when the explosion is happening .
before i &apos;m talking about the cost of the cost , i have to clear that it &apos;s very clear that .
so it &apos;s actually liberation .
but just for recently , we can &apos;t have been , thanks to a technical progression , now the quantum levitation and the quantum locking .
first of strands of strands of strands of strands in floating inside , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like if you move to the motions , you &apos;re so <unk> .
so , this circular magnet , i can also expand to shape a arbitrary rail .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams . the situation is from &quot; by hitchhiking by the galaxy . &quot;
because they don &apos;t explain how to do this , if you want to do it yourself , and not a <unk> .
but even though they were convinced they said , &quot; okay , we call it back . &quot;
<unk> : yeah , i have .
so some of them will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s <unk> on his borders ? &quot;
today , you can buy half a billion , and they &apos;re even better , because they &apos;re faster .
but where is we going to get software ?
larry page has a passionate talk on our <unk> , in which he was doing to provide these great challenges of humanity .
they wanted the fish .
this may sound insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly frightening to hear that a more <unk> , greater than the last one , right , or maybe ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a <unk> moment , a moment where the blogosphere was to fill up .
probably it &apos;s taken within three to five percent of jellybeans in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
someone has to link , so you &apos;re also connected other , etc . , etc .
he finished his <unk> , and i &apos;ll wait a 300 pounds of paper with a higher plans . he &apos;s just say , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to you . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now , to the end of the end of the thing , you know , 30 seconds of the things without the skin .
this habitat habitat over the land over the other land than all of the other habitat together .
many of us , i &apos;m also , thinking that the exploitation of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years ago .
these about a wire , we &apos;re able to <unk> our eyes and hands on the bottom of the bottom .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that &apos;s exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they &apos;re doing that there , we don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand-new article that will be <unk> biology .
but that &apos;s not all of all .
as an architect , i &apos;ve got something to confront .
mitchell <unk> : don &apos;t you a house , they grow it !
i find this very interesting and very , very , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of it , in different directions : directions , the specific and unique for problems .
now , we all think that <unk> is obviously a great romantic poet , many of us remember that he wrote a lot of wonderful <unk> , and the most famous essay is one called &quot;
i &apos;m reading this .
and at a certain time of his life , they <unk> up on rocks .
but let me show you the latest simulation .
when you were used to radio radio , the digital radio , the <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; on the <unk> , that this noise was .
the idea of the <unk> is that you have two sources of sources of sources of sources of sources of the conclusions .
that means that i need to predict the future .
well , there is a very clear example , where a <unk> of me felt very different , when he was produced by one another person .
and in the meanwhile , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules to the other person .
if these dots were cars on a <unk> , they wouldn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain to this a lot of data -- people actually actually do all quite accurate their motions to minimize the negative effects of the noise .
this is from the <unk> of marine iv .
mars has the largest <unk> of the solar system , the <unk> .
this is my <unk> . it was just taken a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is only 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meet was a <unk> <unk> called ares .
we fold it , and we put it in a <unk> .
this is about <unk> , oregon .
i believe in this package , let &apos;s look at here -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these guns to lego because lego -- the <unk> -- no , they &apos;re not on <unk> .
and then there are some examples of the things are real sculptures there .
i have to tell you , for me , that evening everything .
maybe most importantly , the influence of other companies is enormously .
in fact , politics is <unk> .
in brazil , there is <unk> <unk> , whereas the united states only have 700 and <unk> two in california , and within three years , the percentage of <unk> is to 85 percent .
that &apos;s not <unk> . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists explain -- and these are just estimates that we have to halve the vancouver from greenhouse gases , and that quickly as possible .
i can &apos;t wait what we &apos;re going to be tedsters about the crisis .
there are no people who are still available , which you could , and then you get this <unk> curve , and you get this classic <unk> curve .
b is at the edge of the network .
and that happens to every cattle .
the red dots are going to be the <unk> , and the yellow dots are friends of the people with flu .
would you get the immunity to <unk> ?
and there is , i think three types of data can be used to this <unk> data .
the building was in construction to collapse of the <unk> economy and the death of the <unk> at the beginning of the 90s .
although it seems to be a hot place to be , if you see it from top , it turns out to be a whole network of <unk> and channels that tie every single house every single house .
in this tradition , the future names are all their possessions , which they &apos;re going to be bringing her new husband .
what a place like the <unk> david is special importance , is this kind of <unk> , where people have a basis that they can do .
we can only ask : &quot; how do the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot; and learning it immediately -- or whatever we want to ask .
it replaces the workers with technology .
you can see the left in the screen , you can see some symbols in the screen , which is what happens with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always getting older .
or even if we &apos;re going to drive our cars so that we can visit people .
they were gone in a moment .
it &apos;s been more obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the hood will help me the outcome on the screen .
one of the journalist said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the <unk> are <unk> , as a jewish <unk> .
i think there are some of the reasons , actually many reasons , but there &apos;s only some of us on the moment .
he was attracted to fire , he was <unk> her , he was like a <unk> to light , a little bit of a <unk> .
let me go off door door to the <unk> community , and see if i can see if you &apos;re a <unk> or troops for those division .
but he was too late for sergio .
he saw her .
<unk> power : a complicated hero
this is what happens jobs and possibilities all over the whole .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the free of food because actually this year , and 2008 , in the <unk> of the <unk> of food , for every single <unk> calories .
and i &apos;m going to go into these stores if you &apos;re there , or you &apos;re in the field to see what you can get , and i &apos;m sure you can &apos;t get food .
we see change in participation in schools .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i &apos;ve found is that they &apos;re investing instead of <unk> and other things , invest in a school school .
thank you .
we could do the same thing at cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me how many <unk> i <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours , which i &apos;m doing .
that has never been shown .
the <unk> of these jets is so large that we can see a neutron in this technology .
that the tumor doesn &apos;t have to shrink .
if the magnet is big enough , and your unraveling enough , you can actually actually see all the proteins in the body and start to understand individual system .
most of us find it comforting and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about the <unk> of a <unk> person .
so if i think this -- -- a hundred seconds , they would be uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and you would leave the hall in places .
they all have seen . and this is the melody that &apos;s the time to hear the time in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends of mine , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
while we cross miles and miles of <unk> cross -- <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
so as i &apos;m here today and i &apos;m talking to you today , i &apos;ve gone to the <unk> of about five years .
just about 10 miles off shore , and in <unk> feet .
the ocean is the climate change , the ocean , and they think it &apos;s stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
<unk> are easy ...
that &apos;s the result , if you don &apos;t know that there are the limits of what we &apos;re going to take the oceans .
in the past three years , the u.s. is <unk> <unk> <unk> sea &apos;s <unk> <unk> sea .
we need <unk> , new technologies to exploration of the ocean exploration .
and i wanted to find out of a lot of my early career , i was trying to figure out how the wings of the insects are actually generating enough strength to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of a mouse from the lab from jeff <unk> , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they <unk> a <unk> to make any behavior , another <unk> has another <unk> and pattern and you can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> computer model of the human brain .
it &apos;s home and drinks tea .
if you look at the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to look at the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re that it &apos;s made little components , because of the <unk> , as in a computer .
how many per <unk> tree is it ? where are you positioned ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , each one in your own processor , it activate , and see what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the mysteries can be solved soon , the <unk> of mind , memory : it &apos;s made out of neurons and electrical signals , and it &apos;s a supercomputer with a supercomputer , to find the brain with <unk> synapses .
it would be necessary or three thousand bombs .
the air force started to build smaller models , and started this .
so that &apos;s what nasa did to get a <unk> to fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people this question , think they &apos;re usually doing something with culture .
the countries on the right side , the people who are very much , they have a slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but it back to get it back , it will more complex .
a online <unk> for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our <unk> .
in fact , in the way , it &apos;s our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- can you use to change the eyes with lower energy .
their intensity can become very quickly and they can be turned off very fast .
they &apos;re critical .
but that &apos;s just by the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other and through the <unk> lights , and then you can communicate and so on .
dna is that , what is mean life is .
it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you can be able to be able to get a genome , and it &apos;s a little bespoke medicine that &apos;s better than today -- it has no side effects .
it &apos;s really simple -- just <unk> genes -- but we could completely .
we don &apos;t run as small organisms alone around the world , but are part of a major ecosystem ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we poison ourselves or the earth , but it &apos;s just the consequence of one of us .
now i &apos;m mostly here because it &apos;s a way for the dog program in the moment where we have a little bit of people who think you &apos;re going to be a dog , first , by making a <unk> , human rules .
they &apos;re just like that &quot; <unk> , &quot; simple , and so they &apos;re being beaten .
no , we &apos;re making , &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try it to six to 10 .
they are like golden <unk> .
and i would say if you didn &apos;t be it , it should not be .
not only with the puppy , but with the rest of the family .
these <unk> are so simple .
their kids are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about energy .
because although i used scientific terms of songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to let them sound .
and less than it &apos;s been accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is a white light of light .
64 with 75 losses .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert is <unk> upwards or two per year .
and homo erectus , the same tool for over 30 generations .
you can teach you in the lab to practice a little bit of <unk> , and there &apos;s actually a <unk> in other animals , but the exchange of an object that has never happened to another .
it &apos;s wealth ; where the pleasure of your own needs to save time .
we &apos;ve done as a species .
but there is no evidence for that .
and as people started to start objects like this far , it was a clue that a exchange of groups existed between groups .
but who knows how to make a mouse mouse ?
but that &apos;s me also because of the links that people are going to take and and that &apos;s never as much as a <unk> way of ideas and to mate and to mate . i &apos;m sure that the technology will continue to improve and so the more profitable .
this is as high as a <unk> building , and i &apos;ve got the fortune of fortune compared .
we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
so if we think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , then , is the rapid development of the problem , because how can we discover things that change the time ?
i talked about -- you know this situation when you don &apos;t diagnose this situation if you don &apos;t diagnose the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we &apos;re a bit of your viruses ; it &apos;s new , so we &apos;re new , so far .
after 10 other days , a fever of them came back -- still -- it has <unk> -- -- it has <unk> -- little oxygen in your lungs .
it hasn &apos;t sequenced a lot .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . no one has seen it before .
a huge battery could be .
let &apos;s invent something that matches the <unk> of the <unk> .
i got a <unk> battery with lower densities to a lower dense , a <unk> with high dense down , and a molten salt .
but david is young and smart and he wants to build a <unk> , and he &apos;s building -- he &apos;s building the very first battery battery with this chemical chemistry .
so what did we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the <unk> , 6 kilometers from the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 feet off of the sea .
and quickly we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to <unk> <unk> and her methods , and how they really found that kids and how much she found that kids are going to discover things and they &apos;re not taught to be in a very high way .
evolution is often as a way that we &apos;ve elected , but it &apos;s actually a huge number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip to the stage of space .
our cities are at risk , there are many of them on shore .
there are stars and so forth .
so if we think about <unk> behavior or language , as the social social social change , it turns out , it turns out to language . so we think about communication .
this expression , also known as a pride , was studied <unk> , and she showed that sighted people and were born by the blind people , and that if you win in a <unk> .
so i thought about it . you get to meet this man and see how they &apos;re involved , and they would be to pretend it , and then they would be involved in ?
what happens in a <unk> , what happens when you turn on the <unk> stage ? how the this little manipulation is , this tiny <unk> ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise for just a few minutes , where you can really apply this ? that &apos;s why we &apos;re of course .
things like things . people are kind of the true i &apos;m . they show themselves .
she was completely depressed , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m not going to look for . &quot;
they need your body , privacy and two minutes , it can affect the other way of the big different .
<unk> swim <unk> to get to her <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of an ant , you &apos;re crawling your brain and drive it up a blade of grass .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have a answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i think that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course they &apos;re extinct in the essence .
but under all those ideas that are actually going to spread our technology around the world , lots of toxic ideas .
and as viruses , we should not try to crush them .
and in my game , you &apos;re called <unk> .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international .
i know you &apos;re going to say , &quot; t , &quot; is not in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , e , d.
nobody would hear each other . nobody &apos;s trusted .
you will see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to that that hasn &apos;t should have happen , but that we should be better , but that &apos;s how to think that you can think of the consequences and the reactions .
they work in <unk> . they &apos;re the driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns about two dollars a day , and i &apos;m suggesting that they &apos;re not getting married to children before these things are done .
finally , desperation , they went and <unk> a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to hold the best speech you ever will ever .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically oneness , the bond of everything and the unit of everything , and its fundamental value was respect , was benign to strangers .
who fights , as he goes ?
they start to go to israel and palestine , in jordan , in the turkey , in syria .
and so , more <unk> and more <unk> , and recently , they have a income to support her family .
just go to somebody with another culture , from another country , with another <unk> , which somehow , in some way , and he &apos;s a conversation , and listen to him .
i start to start where the story began to start in 1985 .
now , before you <unk> , who &apos;s got to take a shower for you .
you see here -- 35 percent of those less famous houses in which 50,000 people live , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning shower .
21 percent of what we can fix is the consequences of <unk> , things that were actually in backwards .
we did that . he got <unk> .
we found out later that in this region , the main cause of disease and death is death .
one thing is the context of everything we did , in the middle of the <unk> , nelson didn &apos;t say , &quot; like slavery and apartheid is not <unk> poverty . it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t mean if you call me a <unk> . really not .
it sounds really <unk> that &apos;s going to say , but if you try to apply it , it &apos;s transformative .
with that point i &apos;m at them , where kids should not rely their community to live in a better lifetime .
this is the youngest <unk> workforce in america with our <unk> bronx .
this is a picture from mayor of the bronx , who &apos;s the kids in his house , not in jail , so they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you were a big kids with small <unk> , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and you create this responsibility for <unk> , which is incredible .
now , you may be wondering about these kids .
keep kids from these shops .
stephen ritz : a teacher who &apos;s <unk> the south bronx
second , i bet you can see here as a <unk> , the difference here is a increase in the <unk> line .
to 10 : <unk> suffered the pig &apos;s pig .
people with migraine headaches , who &apos;s an aura <unk> , a band with <unk> neurons -- here in red -- here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute to <unk> .
the problem is that 30 million americans have been migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we now .
my first wish is that the <unk> of <unk> is for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> -- an acronym acronym -- for the treatment of other <unk> .
of course , the <unk> of the cases in the hopes of <unk> <unk> on <unk> , who are the <unk> patients full of pity for the poor patients .
and a half years ago , four of five of the <unk> in ushahidi , ushahidi , which is called &quot; <unk> &quot; is , &quot; <unk> .
where is what &apos;s really important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve the first time to get it here .
these people below the barrier , i call it <unk> , because they &apos;re really going to be able to share the process of knowledge to share their knowledge with the world .
they have to use connexions as a platform to develop their <unk> and <unk> , which is in 84 countries that teach us teaching the world teaching .
yes , books , maybe we may be sold to 100 or 1,000 spending a year .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that it &apos;s all like it , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the <unk> are over when people say , &quot; so we &apos;d like to have to see three or <unk> of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a couple of thousands of children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s like a new electronic book .
everybody says , this is a $ 100 laptop , which is you can &apos;t do .
and that &apos;s the <unk> .
you click on things , and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all of the love lucy &quot; on a big belt , which is made of information and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think most people think that a mother mother always , and her child is <unk> .
that &apos;s not possible . that &apos;s not .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re living .
first of the <unk> to prevent the <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mentor mothers , and i told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the <unk> is , how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance at the age of four to 22 years , it takes you to be in childhood , which is this graph . it &apos;s <unk> in the early adolescence .
the idea that her father is singing in the public , so it was <unk> .
this is the <unk> that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited to install the <unk> <unk> museum in austria , and to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that it stayed online , 24 hours a day , for nearly nine years .
but at night , as we <unk> , i asked the <unk> , the <unk> decided that they would kissed sam <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place that my family has been working on since four generations in the <unk> .
honestly , i have no idea what it has <unk> on themselves , but they &apos;re incredibly <unk> .
the first thing you &apos;re seeing in the <unk> is the terrible force of the <unk> .
he wrapping it up to my leg , it lifts me up , brings me to a vehicle , and i can bring me to a doctor .
it was a deepening of the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about it . &quot;
we &apos;ve calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct <unk> is the end of our direct health .
it just as simple as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> like technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i would like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in everything possible .
you should know that in every community that has already already dramatically grow .
i led three <unk> on antarctica .
but i tell me where they are in and what they &apos;re in . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific .
and we &apos;re looking at the rest of the world .
he coined the phrase &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
and of course , the <unk> and the open seas , but the <unk> , everybody likes to look at it was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge <unk> and huge <unk> .
now , there &apos;s <unk> , immediate , automatic <unk> costs for free of our devices , even in the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate and there is no conclusions , no single answer to it , but if they &apos;re a <unk> , and they say , &quot; well , what are going to say that data ? &quot;
instead he had very carefully documenting what happens to happen , and once technology is to be in an environment and in a community .
so there is , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves <unk> picture .
i mean , this was at least what it has been happy to do .
well , there was a question that i was in a head of time in a head , well , i can do more of the things that i like to do in design and less of those who i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it is from the front of it .
they &apos;re facing a terrible situation without the way .
they &apos;re going to <unk> in hospitals .
so , as a <unk> , for example , i was considered an extraordinary <unk> in <unk> because i memorized the <unk> , and i know how to use <unk> , and i quickly can work with the <unk> .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends , who are in their &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s still , as a <unk> , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
as christian <unk> changed changed and made of <unk> <unk> , made young jewish men in the u.s. and canada and superman who were also back to the bible .
the case of <unk> , the past muslim <unk> of europe
the biggest bad guys , <unk> , not , you don &apos;t want to get these rocks off . so he &apos;s trying to prevent them out of the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and when comes out of the article out ? &quot;

&#91; &quot; &#93; the 99 &quot; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group itself is an extremely <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : from islam <unk>
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it .
let me show you this here .
and when i started designing with the way , i &apos;ve discovered something curious about myself .
so you have the eye and then get the concepts .
but of course china has a massive population .
but what this is is that this kind of data is a form of information is a form of information .
it &apos;s actually a pleasure to deal with you , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named after the eden project in the u.k.
why does it doesn &apos;t smell like potato and <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after a few months of the learning , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same .
this is the basis for the device that these two people have built by the two people .
they made it -- and it has exactly like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
at the time , there &apos;s a series of things in the balance i want to pay attention .
and she didn &apos;t actually figure out the context that she landed in the place .
norman !
i said no no one on <unk> , neither of my mother , my father , my brother , my brother , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , my grandparents , no .
i &apos;m about that . i just about to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage , which i was to find my family and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we &apos;re looking for you .
and then you hope that one of us find around there and small parts .
he had a <unk> and so <unk> from others , female and probably had a lot of smaller family members to achieve his age of 12 years .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation , or will it lead to be the hominid of the human , which exists on earth ?
but will we make this , or will we make nature of their own run ?
one day , a few weeks , or maybe a year later , i was working with my <unk> in a store for <unk> , and i wanted to buy a <unk> -- we had a <unk> plan .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
so , my hint : about 70 layers of this is taking <unk> <unk> .
do you know how much i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet i went to buy a chinese newspaper from san francisco to buy the bird as sensible .
when we <unk> the way around the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect <unk> : sun , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever go again , just with a <unk> . &quot;
and i remember that my father &apos;s a wheelchair out in the wheelchair , and i was walking down to down until down , and the first time the sun was on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll lay you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was getting to me , and i called the school at the school , i called the school , and i said i &apos;d like to call a <unk> book .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and daddy ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i work in my work .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> that flies through a richard serra .
how to hell , how to hell do i do a phone in three weeks when i &apos;ve evolved these things about millions of years ?
each of these elements could be on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the highest taxpayer in <unk> .
i &apos;m looking at individual <unk> and how it flow -- how it folds and flow , it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> ; it &apos;s been <unk> from aluminum , as opposed to it , it &apos;s grown .
that &apos;s the car &apos;s car . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you think it &apos;s next to contemporary architecture , it feels really completely natural .
that &apos;s my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made out of kevlar .
the same after i had done my dr. <unk> , i was lucky to be a member member of a <unk> who used to explore the ocean .
there was one of those <unk> .
it uses red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> to be blind to the red light , and you can see it without seen .
so they use it to eat and to find a mate .
i challenge them to call another science that &apos;s been used for a lot of years that use the technology .
this is a magical place .
so i was doing to rediscover the value of the <unk> .
and on june fifth of june 1995 , i heard a loud bang on the wheel that changed my life , and the one duck was .
and here &apos;s the duck again .
after the price changed my life .
another example of the effects effects of <unk> on life of birds .
so , if i like to say , this is something -- this is the sound of purple .
the way i <unk> it , i can hear and put music with the time .
one of them is &quot; i have a <unk> &apos; &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is from hitler .
now , you &apos;re now , you know , the former <unk> is now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything about it that could be used for a use . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens if teachers are making order ?
and why not ? they trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
it &apos;s so that freedom has a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here is the hardest and the biggest change : we need to be the authority for interpretation and <unk> of the <unk> and the officials .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise they &apos;re going to be over a standstill .
and put on the interest for interest , the <unk> , and the taxes that you can take .
now , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult to take columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he was just a <unk> of the last day .
but the problem of rules and incentives is that they &apos;re doing the job of the job , and they &apos;re doing the job in the world two .
so smart <unk> are better than anything , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any intelligent <unk> can get your time for forever .
why has this idea spreading ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was a extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to be a little bit more accurate , and we &apos;re in -- america and the rest of the world .
this was <unk> , the turtle .
we have to do it here with a full of <unk> .
what i want to show you is , what you need to do is to transport the <unk> of the <unk> uranium .
what would have been when they had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and get the truck , you just saw , somewhere in the <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself , are overwhelmed from the thought of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent me to someone who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very hard thing .
there is many black sheep out there who have done the wrong things and the problems that we have .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s <unk> , a dangerous environment environment .
imagine , we could , because if we could do it , we could achieve more .
the governments who are the most progress , the governments are found that are ways to allow them to do shared value in business business , rather than the government to see the actor who has the unique to see .
maybe i can see here , i can see the brain , and i can change my slice .
i want to zoom in a particular .
come to me a moment to me in the 19th century , which is a <unk> of june .
we could all be so productive , if facebook or twitter don &apos;t have a cost of time .
they were doing <unk> on the british government to get money for creating analytical machines because they thought that these machines would have a tremendous impact for society .
these benefits not only allowed to do these benefits only less wealthy men who &apos;s research , but they also also think of the <unk> , rather than asking just answering questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned about life .
so , once you start to see a little bit of things -- this person has written a whole article and said , &quot; hey , that &apos;s bacteria . &quot;
and all of the ones that are not old enough , they have no idea how this infection happened -- namely , through these <unk> .
there are about 10,000 programs of the poverty .
this would be the frequency of the 26 letters of the <unk> in one of random elected words in a random elected monkey .
wherever life is , you &apos;re going to have these distribution , in contrast to that distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the policeman asks : &quot; are you sure ? hey , buddy , you know you &apos;ve lost that you have lost here ? &quot;
this is the data from a single survey for a single study in zambia , from a few years ago , i &apos;ve got <unk> .
as you see , bruce willis at the time , bruce willis at the time .
you could speak about 10 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars at all , if i had time , or it hit my plan , and i wasn &apos;t just at vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the paper paper on the cell phones , we should develop software that allows you to do with it , without practice , without my <unk> .
that &apos;s less than i was to do that when i went to a <unk> for two weeks .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life , or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need <unk> .
and i promised me that i would like to fly next time , if i would fly around the world , no fuel , will be , to be safe , not being threatened by the <unk> .
i think you need a pilot at the plane who can talk to the universities , who can talk to students , who can talk to students , and it really can make a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
that &apos;s why all of people who believe in the spirit of mind , welcome to be part of this team .
now you just need a laptop .
anyway , africa was a magical place for us .
the next thing i want to do is is to make clarity , is what this problem is , and what it doesn &apos;t .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop the nonsense for a second .
the fact is that we can see the first generation of the disease and that extreme poverty in the eyes can see , look at the ocean , tell it , and you &apos;re .
it &apos;s about nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the most <unk> states who are in the world of the world .
people find it slowly .
and with this one campaign as our chute , my organization , the way , and other groups that the energy and the enthusiasm that out of hollywood to the north of america .
so , step for step , a nurse , a teacher , a teacher , a housewife and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet has changed all your lives , a country can change -- and a continent that has just to write like this , let alone the head , and i &apos;m holding the head down .
lips are no lips , it volcanoes .
now , your job is to realize what this shapes is is , and what kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just <unk> , this sentence is literally , is wrong .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare what we already know about what &apos;s known to us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these types .
pm : i don &apos;t think i don &apos;t think .
how do you handle it , but also with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
so , this shows a different picture of yemen .
my heart was a half time .
this is a list of side effects : if they eat too much salt , like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , you probably end in intensive care .
but soon i had the symptoms for <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i probably never see my home .
i was sitting there and i was talking about the <unk> for the research , and asking him what i would , if i needed a transplant , it could be done for me .
i was hanging on a dozen machines that i thought about life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of those <unk> also has been on the united states in the united states .
and also , the same thing is that the same business that we sold over 80 million pounds of atrazine , the <unk> , &quot; now the antidote to be sold -- a and the same company .
we also started as a <unk> .
what would our most kids tell us , if you had a little bit more <unk> , some of artificial <unk> , and a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit .
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland oakland , in most of our villages , this link .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> over the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for any of the <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s become global .
here &apos;s you , in red , the distribution of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse who looks at the foot of an elephant , and the most part of you will get out of them .
they look like this <unk> and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface of the surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky because they tend to something called <unk> .
<unk> are the redwood of the tree of stability , just like in a cathedral and help the tree , longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> that &apos;s going to see .
but for the time , all the doors of the <unk> doors to go open and the walls .
that was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s look at the <unk> of the first time .
so how do these people have to make these infected computers ?
and you can afford to see it , as we work -- how do work work -- and try to find a way to find a way to deal with it .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see a <unk> down there : <unk> / d / <unk> and if you open this image on your computer , and then <unk> this program .
and if you look at the images of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the mercedes-benz is .
we need to find any way to make sure that everything keeps playing , even if the computer .
but i &apos;m not going to do it .
this person surrounds each other is associated with .
why should we think what he says ? &quot;
what does your future look like ?
these powers disappearing , no one <unk> that 2011 .
it would be good when people were <unk> , and they would be seriously and attend to this , because this would change things , but it would change things in two ways of change .
that means that we can see a copy of the <unk> , if you &apos;re just using a part of the <unk> , this in slow motion and <unk> .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their <unk> and saw that the video of suddenly common like a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go in the distance .
that &apos;s what it was taught to do , since he was five years .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor of the person who taught me how to <unk> .
what is it that is driving you in life today ? not ten years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing with , and it &apos;s going to happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right .
in this moment , aware , or subconsciously , in the moment you &apos;re on to focus on something , you can make it a matter of the things that it means , it makes emotions .
you ever did what , and we &apos;re going to go , &quot; that &apos;s me ! &quot;
so to death , so , god in his endless wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , by friendship , by prayers , by <unk> , by movements .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
<unk> man with family in occupied , someone in new york who had died when he was in the day , and this man who was a terrorist and he was really sure .
instead , i &apos;m interested in the tools that are going to be able to develop a tool with which a great number of people can tell their stories around the world .
the color of particles like the kind of feeling -- happy , positive emotions have colored colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was at the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there &apos;s thousands of feelings that were collected .
the ten topics of the numbers circle and circle over the time .
it &apos;s called &quot; the universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click on this , and see this particular as an <unk> of betty ford as she &apos;s the &apos; &quot;
you can look at a quote if you like to read about climate change .
so people feel clouds like something that is in the way .
in life , it &apos;s been called tens of thousands of members in nearly 100 countries around the earth today .
they just need a step out out to go out and to notice that , so generally , so you &apos;re so banal , that all the other you are missing .
so look up , they admire the <unk> beauty , and you &apos;re always thinking about the head in the clouds .
they &apos;ve seen 25,000 shots pieces that would have been done , &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago , when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> . it was a huge machine .
this footage from an virtual autopsy .
so here you can see how the knife is hacked .
it &apos;s a smaller mechanical pen that has very , very fast <unk> in the inside .
now , this is a really interesting project .
so he &apos;s doing it .
so , very skilled people .
i was talking about kids as often as possible to bring the academic stuff with the real world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> summary of everything we know about the nature of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the detail why we imagine the universe , but it makes the physics of mathematics and trying to explain physics .
i always , in my career , i always do something in me .
in 2001 , i went to her during a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is the one point after the first degree in 2004 .
he &apos;s just a <unk> degree of the <unk> and i was filmed with somebody who you all know .
each will have a <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s being specialized in different scientific disciplines .
i &apos;ve got my first computer as a teenager , and it was a really great device .
and he explores the brain using fmri , and he argued that , this is the nicest brain that has ever been scanned .
so , the next few slides will i &apos;m going to tell you briefly .
transistors are going to allow us to allow the to allow us to allow our technology much better .
our <unk> is behind this lens .
i had such a gut feeling that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so , we know what is a schwarzschild radius .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than anywhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the notion that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could have a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s going to be much more powerful than the other side , and the cloud will be torn apart .
and i hope that i &apos;m hoping at least i believe you really , that we have a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was walking in the streets of new york walking , and i saw some kids between stairs , cars and fire baseball .
so for example , the people like the 11th of the 11th pieces , which was so on .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the great &quot; in which is god to appreciate god and to pay .
through new and improved instruments , the age of the <unk> .
but one question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
michael thomas thomas : music and feelings over time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new <unk> .
until the year , it took it to 100,000 every year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but i was recently looking at an interest in an <unk> of a new view of view , because there is the circumstances where they can really make this thing really cool .
well , i think this is the <unk> development of the phenomenon we call &quot; user-generated innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important thing .
we get a quick talk from them .
let me imagine this point sam <unk> .
but even if you &apos;re a screen , you know , there &apos;s much more <unk> than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how <unk> global innovation lead innovation .
first , i have to take a service to the audience and talk about what i &apos;m going to give you , instead of saying what i cannot offer .
and they &apos;re having fun to design their own , the ultimate <unk> or the worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , so a kind of <unk> that we call the superpower .
so , these kind of tests do this , ok ?
someone asked why ? &quot;
and he thought he could reverse the waves .
i think there are three major changes in the field of transparency , choice and <unk> , where people have really power .
how do we do this ?
my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , claims , all the world exist more photos from their back than anyone else .
11 of other countries .
and the second thing , they were watching the teachers who are <unk> and thousands of minds , as an helpful tool , because they took specific areas of the things that make a sense of meaningful sense .
so i &apos;m going to be a nice weekend .
reading dna and write , it &apos;s always easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have this <unk> around the world , this can lead to a <unk> , who allows to do biotechnology .
the laws of claims to him , strangers are <unk> or <unk> , which is an economic risk or a <unk> or a risk for health or the <unk> of the state .
these laws are a slap in the face of science and based on prejudice and ignorance and an <unk> from traditions and an carpenter .
why are you pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 <unk> is to people who inject drugs .
so that social worker , the condoms are spreading to endangered <unk> , not even be <unk> , names or <unk> .
here were children born , people died there .
learning office for personal work now are obsolete now .
they cut the high line , the road <unk> , the the river below the road , and you &apos;re coming from a end of the <unk> to the other , without cross the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny homes . &quot;
and jobs should be shared .
your liver is <unk> oil .
and they killed around 12,000 sharks at the time by just a <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> bay in achill island .
we know very little bit about it .
so this tags , this is actually , the place of a shark , depending on the time and sunset , the water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> of what to do with the genes that are being on the parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , a factor of 10 less diversity than other <unk> .
so , <unk> this research and found that the size of the jellyfish is to be the jellyfish .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build it . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists , whether it was a male or female .
so i decided to give myself the <unk> .
their bodies become <unk> , and they &apos;re being used for any <unk> to make money -- people tell many of those stories .
no businesses don &apos;t do with anybody .
my journalism may have on other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , in my part of africa , it &apos;s about , and ask about corruption , people immediately , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks removed from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be as a <unk> <unk> .
and they were ever met a victim of their <unk> victims ?
today , you can live in 29 states , in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality , is fired for you .
and at some point i realized that my mission &quot; gay &quot; too was flawed , because there was a million different <unk> of the gay <unk> .
at least i hope it will be difficult to be more difficult to your human rights .
one : the world is , and it &apos;s always been good and bad , because good and evil , yin and yang are the <unk> .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 images that had made the soldiers .
in three ways : the conventional way is called the conventional way .
this is stanley milgram , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could be going to be happening here , right now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when it happened ? &quot;
stanley <unk> and i closed , by the way both 1954 , the high school , the <unk> <unk> in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of the <unk> of it and anonymity .
<unk> of the other . <unk> of the self .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil through the heart of one every person .
and i put the experiment in the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did , &quot; i did , what everybody could do , &quot; no matter of the tracks .
it &apos;s a puzzle that was really hard to be .
we have one self .
but on my left retina , a <unk> , which is the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one <unk> , which is the body .
i promise i &apos;m not going to say nothing to be <unk> .
and the autobiographical self has changed memory , thinking about creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the <unk> -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m going to tell you this -- i &apos;m telling you and <unk> , i &apos;m ridiculous because i think feminism has partly the task , to admit that , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want to be a heroine .
you can see , i don &apos;t put myself on fire .
she talked about <unk> , she started <unk> , they started <unk> <unk> , they <unk> friends -- all of those everyday acts of care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this <unk> , which is different from the homo <unk> of <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s a sensor for brainwaves that reads the electrical activity in my brain while i think that &apos;s the talk .
we <unk> numerous prototypes and products that you can control with thoughts , like <unk> appliances , or a <unk> chair .
the headset is wirelessly connected to an ipad or smartphone .
how these kids can use their new minds of their recovery , many of the <unk> and <unk> social <unk> , which people who are diagnosed as well , to see .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re doing on people , changes , <unk> and growing .
and he said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
so , i &apos;m going to be a bit unexpected , they gave them up .
this specialist thought not to investigate my eyes .
i walked a track that i &apos;m good .
and it &apos;s very slowly .
i didn &apos;t really believe in my belief , not really , not really , not all of the <unk> of me , all the small <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . i mean .
what we have is the same thing that we have is the same thing , but in one of them feel great , and in the other , with just a small change in the posture , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that &apos;s going to happen to happen , which is going to be in control that we have over our tax .
for <unk> percent of that money , you could have put in their hands , which cannot reduce the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the use more much more improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the full one of the other things that i &apos;m asking .
sometimes they &apos;re very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as an <unk> discipline of the psychology of human psychology .
if the average answer was 50 to 60 percent .
it will tell you that they &apos;re neither themselves , other people else .
yay .
it &apos;s 20 , 30 years .
but that would not mean that i have a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that &apos;s our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
we had sufficient to hyperscore , actually , in fact , really powerful effects in children all over the world , and now in humans , everybody &apos;s ages .
it &apos;s about a man rich , successful , powerful , that &apos;s forever alive forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old .
this is actually the score of <unk> piece that he has completely in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , we do a <unk> .
there &apos;s first of the present self .
i have to write five sides in the day , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the final thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last <unk> machine machine , is something i created with hal <unk> , who was introduced by my co-author with a previous project .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not influenced by people , because when one of the faces smiles , then the other face is gloomy .
this is one of the reasons that this is so much of what we think about western science , mathematics and <unk> , actually in the first few centuries of our <unk> of our <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown , because it &apos;s not a sh . &quot; sh .
so it &apos;s not surprising that when you talk about mental illness , you &apos;re probably <unk> from <unk> suffering , shame and discrimination in almost all of life area .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world was in <unk> and gave the legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve already heard of fish .
so , look at this profit , you see that nearly 8,000 of this dollar are actually <unk> .
this was in the early <unk> , as india was going to make his <unk> &apos;s <unk> -- as a means to china , after china , in its <unk> growth , nine , 10 percent , and said , why can we not do that ?
they don &apos;t get it happy , but they have trust and the courage and the courage , <unk> and to say , &quot; that we calculated .
green carbon , which is the emissions from deforestation and agriculture , and the blue carbon , all of us , 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things mean , dick , in fact , unfortunately , in the way .
i also liked these intellectual <unk> .
and he said he &apos;d have been basically the same relationship with his father .
there was a theory .
he did in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t have to move through the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole <unk> of the whole <unk> , and the <unk> color that these simple fantastic <unk> .
many of these ideas , <unk> into an <unk> for airstream .
if you think about your kids to the tinkering school , they will come back with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let them play with their own conditions , and they trust me , they &apos;re learning things that you can &apos;t learn from the <unk> of the learning .
if you want to throw a device of a device , you don &apos;t .
i think that &apos;s all . it &apos;s number <unk> . okay .
so here you see , you see , you see , the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife to wander today , four months afterwards , and in the <unk> of the city .
how about a completely <unk> <unk> , not just the parts ?
this is one of the seven nor existing <unk> that were not going to be a shot .
and so it came to buy the <unk> of europe , in the first , to get thousands , then thousands of thousands and then , and finally , hundreds of thousands of neurons , which should be able to be able to be able to the middle of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden of the outside of the box .
as edison invented the light bulb , she looked like this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i don &apos;t have a <unk> , that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid because you can &apos;t be stupid and it in the world .
they literally have the door .
if you listen to your <unk> , listen to your girlfriends , both two ears two .
we have the problem that the antenna is an antenna .
thank you very much .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i drew her special special card , and i wrote her name on it , <unk> them and they sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see , i can see how you <unk> .
and i believe that it &apos;s <unk> is , my valuable and valuable lifetime of life on this earth is exactly the same way .
in this mode , he tried to hold his position .
i thought i was a little bit of how nature creates materials .
we think about different technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see it <unk> , you see , in the amino acids , where they have different charges .
and through a series of <unk> , you can do a billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery , a battery is growing or a solar cell .
in this case you see <unk> .
when you ask people ask , where do you go to you if you &apos;re doing something important ?
i used to sit on my desk , my expensive computers .
and then , what happens -- sometimes you wake up , where you wake up in the morning , or to wake up , or when they just stand up , and you &apos;re going to say , man , i don &apos;t really slept .
in the office , most of <unk> and distractions that are actually stopping people from work , <unk> .
we all know that this is true . you would never experience a <unk> meeting that by employees .
meetings and managers are the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every single week , every week , the week , the week , the one of whom is to talk to .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this for seven years , and i have no idea what the future is going to look like .
but if you ask people to the three things that you &apos;re wearing , -- no matter what culture and the gender and whatever -- people know , the key , money , and if you own one , the cell phone .
but , and this is a very big , but we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent more <unk> and then -- the owner of the ship takes 10 or 20 percent <unk> , and you have the rest of the amount of bar to my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he somehow got an admiration for the values of <unk> .
at the same time with the spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our current reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares with new research that show how the <unk> of healthy lives can affect the genetic level , and he says , if we live healthier , and exercise and more like , can actually reproduce our brain cells actually reproduce .
until i tell you who &apos;s told .
within that context , we can &apos;t feel regret about many different things .
when i went home to home after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there is a fifth one .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; answer to all the <unk> can let us go back for days .
and as i said , i &apos;m a <unk> .
i thought i was going to be in preparation at my ted wish , and what i try to do , and how to do that , what they &apos;re trying to do .
no one in india . now , at least a half a million active .
and i came to the idea that somebody in this whole kind of <unk> world has to think about the organization of the <unk> .
and so we did this to do that .
listen to this : less than four tenth of one percent of the percent who have been treated , they stopped their medicine or <unk> in their own way , and their treatment .
it &apos;s worth a try and think that it would be successful .
the <unk> is not <unk> .
when the <unk> is used , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
the local women &apos;s cooking from bali &apos;s food on food and they use secrets that just their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and i looked at this .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal vocal was still healthy and not light . &quot;
then apple alex out , the best voice i &apos;ve heard .
there was a reason for this : that &apos;s me .
the <unk> is not of course .
but that &apos;s not about it .
at the beginning , the internet was a <unk> tool for me , now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to leave for my real , and i &apos;m going to run on my life .
it &apos;s human to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing turing test .
i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you alive ? &quot;
we treated two <unk> pages as a single page , because the readers is true .
so what is the lesson behind ?
and one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not walking off .
it <unk> and terrible things happened with me .
everybody lost hope in my cure .
so they went to her <unk> and all collected their <unk> furniture -- they gave me a pots and <unk> , <unk> , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away this street , and you don &apos;t know if they go straight and they hear cars and forth , and they had an awful crash , which has taken her .
i thought that for some reason , the time was staying and only for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say , we would have discovered all the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it around because i have a small barrier in it , right ?
if i <unk> a magic move , and then one , it &apos;s a third .
galois has set up a series of laws like these tables , these symmetries , interact .
one of these symmetry we call <unk> .
instead of all of the mess , i want to know how many digits are the number . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects , basically , please spell it for me .
first : worse diets , maybe shorter diet .
thomas edison would have a very <unk> company in a company company .
penicillin was discovered , but even in 1940 , not commercial and pharmaceutical amounts of them made a lot of them .
it was the kind of <unk> of the <unk> , which had his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos is happening . do we make the best thing .
it works in every computer and browser . minus minus minus minus , minus the text and the text .
they don &apos;t need extra to delete them too .
and so , it &apos;s a kind of information that i &apos;m going to be inspired by my real desk .
a means to be about it as a <unk> , so that you get more and more and the things that are things in grid .
now i get to the heart of the people who are people and there is no longer .
but i think that &apos;s a little bit of it . and with this one thing i want to suggest today is that we &apos;re a little <unk> , that we &apos;re not just <unk> , but mathematics is in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists on wall street , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find here : this is a book about flies that you might have on amazon .
these are not <unk> ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very much .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go it . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> without traffic lights , so , with <unk> , save a lot of life , but there &apos;s a excess of excess coming from .
the answer is , to allow the car to allow you to get safe from this side of the road .
warren buffet had this stated : honestly to tell what works and what to do and make this happen to a year .
in fact , we see the <unk> that it &apos;s the only known disease because of the in africa , in africa , in africa , in africa , have been able to be able to get out of the <unk> .
this means that the economy is in these areas , because it &apos;s just so <unk> .
but that alone is not yet a <unk> .
not only it was weak ; it &apos;s going to cheat .
a teacher &apos;s teacher is going to be the performance of his class -- measured by <unk> -- in a year to raise 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not to be a better way to be a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and these free courses couldn &apos;t only be available on the internet , but you can also deploy dvds anywhere available to each other with access to a <unk> that &apos;s very much teachers .
traditional vessels like this cup , needs eight to 10 hours of the burning .
sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought he was a young artist , he was a painter and he lived in a <unk> .
so if i look at these photos , i <unk> back in my clothes , i went home to my family home .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know that you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us as powerful ?
this is a general in boston .
so the pathologist takes the sample of the data , it takes a <unk> , it &apos;s looking at it under the microscope and then then the operating room .
so in this particular , a solution , with these <unk> <unk> , pictured with a dye , pictured here , here , in green , and <unk> into the <unk> of one cancer disease , can &apos;t separate these molecules .
with <unk> lymph node as part of our current today , the surgeon is for the individual node , the lymph nodes begins where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , you can cause spinal cord cord cord .
if we <unk> these two samples .
we know that this is doable , and we &apos;re discovering this to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different <unk> that we learn .
it will affect the normal circuits as the <unk> they want to fix them .
and one in the back of 2004 , we &apos;ve tried it and i &apos;ve been working on it .
we &apos;ve shown that already , you can put it down , that we &apos;re able to use this , to learn learning .
and it goes on . now .
i want to end with a story that we think it might be in clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually can actually go up the walls and can use your eyes again .
buildings are colonized with the air , <unk> microbes that through the window and above the <unk> .
and when they stop outside , the air , the air microbes that are associated with <unk> and <unk> .
obviously , i &apos;m a physically powerful person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t worry about this thing to be 20 blocks .
the same thing is true for the question of who &apos;s been alive after 9 / 11 of the streets in my neighborhood .
and you can get a list .
one of those things i &apos;m experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you just take a abstract term and looking at google afterwards , and then you look for the name of someone .
that &apos;s britney copious <unk> . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , you know , you &apos;re one of the most .
what we &apos;ve all been normal for us about 40 years ago -- that tell stories about generations -- is now rare .
in 1939 , the film older than most people of our members .
was the story of good ?
why don &apos;t we <unk> this , why we don &apos;t see this same passion as this ?
in california , they &apos;re going to be <unk> by a <unk> , &quot; this product contains chemicals that &apos;s the state of california , which is the state of california , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so we may be able to develop a <unk> solution , and for my career as an architect , it &apos;s a <unk> that the words &quot; <unk> &quot; since the eternal <unk> &quot; has no longer mentioned in the same .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was : &quot; the stone age wasn &apos;t because we &apos;ve made the rocks out . &quot;
and this can be really fine , but we &apos;re built in houston , and all the windows are closed . and with all the products that obviously , the obviously , is a vertical <unk> .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you are using it .
since we &apos;ve been <unk> the <unk> of the most pervasive <unk> in a database that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to put the public .
now we have 160 kilograms of heavy <unk> to learn the <unk> on the internet .
we started commercial and mixed with buildings intertwined so so that all people and places where they can stop .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let anyone tell you that we already knew all of it because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , you &apos;ll give you that the <unk> at microsoft &apos;s september in the 9 / 11 , 2008 , and then the other one : google , facebook , skype , apple and so on .
i elected sweden because sweden are similar laws , like the united states .
and whoever tells you , he didn &apos;t have nothing to hide about it just for long enough .
and they read their emails , and she talked to the <unk> and said , &quot; if there is no one level to privacy , it cannot be real freedom and therefore , not effective democracy . &quot;
many people , if you see a <unk> human brain , say , &quot; usually it looks different when you get your brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas that the regions are going through .
and the nature of a particular cell to basically <unk> biochemistry is that it determines , which is the 25,000 genes that are switched on and what threshold they switched on .
now experts come into play and make some fundamental anatomical <unk> .
we take the material , and put it into a so-called <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genomes and you try to find the <unk> that are linked to the genes .
whether this is from the individual genetic background or their experience , we don &apos;t know .
we we know how to eliminate poverty , we need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how can you know it ?
so what is the problem ?
well , it was all right .
and there were many experiments that came all the same outcome , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what is the best thing ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it . and we need to move the policy .
and maybe we &apos;re going to start small , with things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re in .
so , to temper poverty is more <unk> than scientific work and a lack of data on the effects of <unk> , the question of the things that makes the question of the <unk> , but <unk> esther duflo , it &apos;s possible to help out what damage -- with help studies .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way of the change .
and legend is reported that alexander &apos;s been moved through this desert .
but you might say , &quot; invest in africa with a thousand languages , and it would be not going to be . &quot;
so , let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk this from the perspective of the <unk> .
in tanzania , last week , the standard of <unk> was called the life .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what was the world &apos;s best performance in 2005 ? &quot; would you think of egypt ?
because there is amazing possibilities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey that we want to be to be inspired and feel the one with the universe , that &apos;s life .
you <unk> a switch -- there &apos;s an electrical light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought .
i &apos;m going to run this way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to describe it , and i &apos;m seeing that for the first time .
all right .
ok , you go , raise your right hand .
kt : aye .
kt : no , no . i just see the road .
i couldn &apos;t see the blindfold .
again , again .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
so let your eyes close , five , four , three , two , one .
just if you want the pressure down , you &apos;re going to do it , you &apos;re doing a <unk> , so , but only if you want to get rid of it .
do you want to try ?
the same is that you feel a certain sensation and if you feel emotion , i want you to throw the <unk> into the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , this is like , in <unk> .
kb : ok . do it think he &apos;s here , yes , right ?
first of us , a keith &apos;s how our brain can actually be able to <unk> our body -- with a trick with the <unk> , and then he does the audience in some astonishing <unk> of the brain magic .
i <unk> .
this is not for the &quot; one of four . that &apos;s all four .
i observed that both religious people are equally obsessed with the same of morality .
the <unk> is almost zero if there is no stimulation to the <unk> .
and they get following the following the computer : &quot; person 1 has sent to them up .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is increased the <unk> of <unk> to 80 percent .
i just found that a molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
we have <unk> testosterone testosterone .
this tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new few of their own .
and it &apos;s very easy to engage a brain to <unk> .
to run the device , you need many , many people .
or should you like that ?
they were very <unk> , &quot; you gave us a device that &apos;s only in english , so we &apos;ve been teaching english to use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
nonsense . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
how is this tomorrow ?
we have to make this mismatch , by threat .
i think it &apos;s right now .
i &apos;ve been asking quite incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will they end ? &quot;
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i &apos;ve lost the thread just completely lost .
<unk> went to local <unk> , and the local <unk> , and found that he was taken in the official <unk> as removed .
that &apos;s why this is the domain of <unk> .
<unk> is in the privileged , and it &apos;s able to pay multiple <unk> and multiple households , they were common .
after these four children , you see the <unk> younger sister who were killed in their children who were also killed .
and finally , there was a single one that was sitting in the <unk> , and later his participation , so i had to <unk> it to the <unk> .
with 16 children who left children who left the orphanage , although they can &apos;t anywhere .
one of the interesting things is , of course , the naked hand is the instrument and the technology , and of course , what he &apos;s going to listen to our young people .
now my career is going to continue a little longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from the sound of the sound through the chamber .
or we do this , and believe that this is blindness .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual stroke is intertwined , but why can &apos;t i do that if i learn a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> , the pigeon <unk> <unk> <unk> , why can hear the hearing of music to be able to be able to be able to to be able to be able to be able to to be able to be able to be able to to be able to be able to be able to to be able to be able to be able to to be
and it was so big , until the point where it was <unk> at the last year , <unk> <unk> and rick <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; million people on television .
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;re lucky to be able to be transmitted to them live .
peace and love was mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what to keep them .
that &apos;s 10 times longer than the mammals needed to achieve their maximum height size and to seize all those habitats .
we are very much like dinosaurs dinosaurs , and we &apos;re very unusual in our <unk> attitudes to live .
basically , it &apos;s a country that &apos;s not a <unk> at the beginning of our work .
this is a adult <unk> in his pine jaw .
paul has never seen a fossil way .
these are all <unk> . there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
i became an artist and started to draw .
the question is -- and we &apos;re dealing with this question for centuries -- how to engage in science .
bad news for derartu tulu , though , some other runners had the same idea , including the olympic <unk> and paula radcliffe , which is a huge , the fastest <unk> of all of times .
show me an animal with a <unk> and gills , it has something to do with water .
we don &apos;t use our physical strength because we &apos;re the largest <unk> in the jungle .
well , emily <unk> -- a of 500 <unk> and <unk> -- they &apos;re looking at the eighth place , under the best 10 , although they had made up to her baby -- and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
it &apos;s hearing to put on the focus on these <unk> , where you failed when you need four hours .
and so , with the technology , it &apos;s always been around with things , not with people -- not in a social way , which is of course , and the people really really help people really to accept what we really need to accept the way of our everyday lives .
cookie is very , the monster is very , very bad .
the <unk> was a experimenter of our group , where they used three one from three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can be able to become the active participant in life in your grandchildren , in a way that it is not possible today .
and the third way was a simple journal with paper , and the pen , because that &apos;s the most <unk> that you normally use when you start a <unk> and <unk> .
another key idea is this notion of the <unk> <unk> of the character .
i have a way , and i was looking at it really hard because it &apos;s not <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s gone away , not too far . i fire : &quot; bang ! &quot; the <unk> is falling between two <unk> cars .
when he wrote to a <unk> , i was before the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do <unk> , books and a little bit of advertising , everything with the same concept .
from photography , this <unk> is , you want to taste and <unk> . what you can &apos;t have , you want to do more .
as you think about collective consciousness , without the time we know , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very <unk> .
and then you &apos;re going to see the photograph he &apos;s called , and suddenly it becomes a rather serious and maybe less accessible .
eighty-five percent of the global health care for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet , 90 percent of the resources in the west .
it &apos;s easy to treat . look at the location in the island .
but if you &apos;re told that , we try to do the same thing in nigeria , and then all go .
they allow the existence of the ecology , and we can use very smart .
now , prevention needs to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important .
and we start a <unk> technology program so we can fix local people who can fix the equipment .
now , autism has a very large variety of a massive variety of very massive , the child &apos;s not designed to be a language -- until to be brilliant scientists and engineers .
<unk> love i love the film , how you all have <unk> <unk> . that &apos;s the <unk> in me .
now , what i learned was because i was not so <unk> , to sell my work , and not myself .

it &apos;s a distributed reality , the projection and systems can link , or simply a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i &apos;m standing on this shore , the <unk> <unk> i look out on the distant horizon , and i think it will be able to do it , all the way around the vast , dangerous <unk> of a ocean .
but it was more like a lot of life left there ?
and then , there is our <unk> that you really never tell me how far it is , we know , how far it is .

and i know , many of you have meant that these airbags are really cool things .
there were two <unk> , who were interested in interest in particular .

thank you .
most of the cultural heritage is going to look back and look around the past .
my first report for national geographic i noticed that you can bring environmental environmental issues in a documentary that can bring to the history of nature , i had to <unk> .
these are the lion and tigers of the seas .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m kind of interested in this -- i wanted to do a different , rather positive history about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i had <unk> , i learned that this human habitat is going to create a new <unk> .
they also caught in <unk> .
but when the fish came back and again , and again , the population of sea trees and the population grew up in shallow water .
so you &apos;re living in the jungle of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , your second son , the way also the second of the second of the second of the world i saved .
it was a biological desert .
then you see the returns and starts measuring what &apos;s coming out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to sequester the nitrogen to sequester , and without these <unk> .
it &apos;s 10 percent higher .
so we can really change the climate .
in <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> , there is a democratic culture , so you can use the heart of the own system .
the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you one .
<unk> <unk> creates <unk> sculptures , beautiful works in the patterns , or <unk> waves move , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s <unk> us with his favorite art -- and the same with nature .
every city has their own design .
twenty-three years later , we asked us to come and this idea of <unk> .
this is italian portal , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the japanese space , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program , or something , but no , part of the science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t doubt about existence of your own minds .
it &apos;s a digital program in the brain and to make awareness , we just have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly taking the objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and as features of the standards .
... don &apos;t you find ?
but i &apos;m also , i &apos;m also , people who do what they do , and you can &apos;t imagine something else .
we don &apos;t teach american story in the u.k. .
teenagers don &apos;t wear a <unk> .
maybe later , not immediate .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t work this thing to work , no matter how often i have .
but we need to change from a industrial model to a <unk> , where every single school can flourish .
so erez and i wanted to find more about it .
the reason for this is that the historical report is going to be digitized at <unk> speed .
there was a light on . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s serious .
she brought a group of students in a protest in the streets of <unk> .
i stood on , i was a tea , i sat down and everything , and now i &apos;m here -- still , i &apos;m here , but here .
and peace direct <unk> , they <unk> the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy &quot; with <unk> <unk> to the <unk> resistance .
it &apos;s not so much as a <unk> thing .
and he actually got chris worried and he said , &quot; look , let &apos;s show you this photograph , you &apos;ll think you &apos;re another of those crazy disabled , that &apos;s not much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for mind .
and the solution that i &apos;m looking at the most of the biggest <unk> in this massive <unk> of the earth is by the human earth and the <unk> of the biosphere .
so i asked , &quot; what would we call it <unk> , where they were <unk> the effects in the denominator -- we call it <unk> , bring out where they were the impact of the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge <unk> on the market that has increased our sales and profits .
we literally won <unk> .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my guys in california .
so , frankly , are a lot of us who work in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and possibly <unk> .
and we really need somebody to convey for us to convey a experience with a mentally divine .
the arts , whatever they do , the place we get in the time , when you &apos;re going to look at our own to <unk> and curiosity .
three sisters <unk> <unk> with their passionate new life , with tedwomen , she start with the jolly and <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; from david <unk> . afterwards she plays a <unk> , <unk> version of <unk> <unk> &quot;
the manchester craftsmen &apos;s craftsmen is named after my quarter .
he makes a bunch of money through using special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the <unk> of the american <unk> , which is what harvard &apos;s harvard &apos;s <unk> , and we <unk> a <unk> for mothers in the middle of the city of downtown .
we have noticed that you &apos;re going to be flowers and the sunlight and food and herbie &apos;s music and so you can &apos;t cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up by the world , the high public school , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of and and sunlight and the sunlight and the sunlight and <unk> and confidence .
and it has worked very well .
and i will allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and should you ever decide to sell a deal that the money is used to help the school . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson , which was made her album in our school last christmas last christmas .
so the brown buildings , which you &apos;ve seen you , and i &apos;m telling you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me afterwards . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he &apos;s got a group of people <unk> .
bill <unk> tells a calm and amazing tale of <unk> by art , music and unusual alliance .
and the transducer , then the <unk> to the <unk> to the code to the brain , and the code is a <unk> that produces a normal <unk> .
but there was the most <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells make better answers , to make ordinary reactions , and so that was our contribution .
they cover us from a invisible <unk> , which attacks from the environment that we remain healthy .
but when bacteria grow and then double and to have to get to the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to make these molecules , the number of molecules , the the cell is proportional to the cell .
now we know that all of the bacteria can speak together .
this is just a photograph -- a <unk> of her skin .
bacteria are incredibly <unk> , which is the back of the world is that we kill bacteria .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they can fulfill tasks that they can never happen to be able to be able to do it as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to me to get to this conference .
or the first thing that come in the hall .
but if we think about justice , aristotle says , the real nature of the most of the <unk> activity and qualities that it &apos;s worth that you &apos;re , <unk> and see .
what &apos;s why they would have ?
charlie , what are she say to warren ?
here &apos;s how he <unk> it .
so aristotle , aristotle with flutes , <unk> and the fierce of <unk> questions of same-sex marriage was right .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument .
so many people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> , don &apos;t tell us of the other guys , what we should start with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future of humanity is to meet a decision .
so , if that &apos;s like this , what is that ?
i would argue that the speed of the world &apos;s speed is going to claim .
i &apos;m going to suggest that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that the threshold because we don &apos;t have any more <unk> , before we get to the age of age , and that even though the damage was from our birth .
that &apos;s what you have to do their homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read that in the last 20 years , the average life of the average life of the planet has been expanding for 10 years .
not one of your media has been able to do it .
we don &apos;t matter how we &apos;re doing our profit .
they <unk> in the center of <unk> and put up on the agenda .
i can &apos;t present any <unk> evidence that are the <unk> as the arguments that i &apos;ve learned from economists , epidemiologists and <unk> .
the <unk> is something scary , and probably you &apos;re familiar with a part of the <unk> .
fourteen americans die every day at asthma , who had three times like in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
he apparently had a sense of humor .
politicians and <unk> have been afraid of <unk> as a <unk> .
second , because we &apos;ve been eradicated .
so we thought , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do it . &quot;
there you find some amazing animals .
immediately the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;re going to go . &quot; and paying people to see every single <unk> that they saw .
he may be thinking , he would have been born , so he would have a little bit of things out outside .
and i asked peter , if something changed something , and he said , &quot; no .
we want to be here with africa : the next chapter , and this is a healthy , <unk> , <unk> , beautiful african .
but all of all you have to be engaged in their lives , and a kind of productive environment , in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can do that all ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to crawl between the legs of these guys , with my sister to find a window .
you know , we need to use all good use .
and often i don &apos;t see african employees under them .
the question is now , how we can use , we can use from all this good will , which is going to happen ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective with a <unk> product , i took this thesis to do so that we can study it exactly as we can study any other complex <unk> process .
the method has been used since the 90s , to investigate all of the <unk> of the 90s .
i want to try to show this for a second .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here &apos;s games in the change .
how do you study a scientific scientific now ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s been involved in <unk> .
i want to say that probability and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and <unk> .
this is very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the thoughts for eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , their facial expressions are used to be used to control a avatar , or virtual character .
otherwise they spoil very fast . and without a stable grid grid that doesn &apos;t happen , so they die .
another one of <unk> was that we react when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be made by the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have any road , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your <unk> , a very cheap blue laser .
audience : aye .
and what &apos;s interesting is , even though we have <unk> all the time , we &apos;ve never done it , the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant house .
this <unk> that you see here , actually , in a <unk> , which is made out of the outside of the outside and <unk> .
so , water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and earth is still .
the idea is not perfected .
you don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touched water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a human species should be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to give you a little bit more than there ?
we realize that once that worked , once that worked , a real chance would have , if we could bring the procedures chromosomes to bring it out of bacteria .
so care is <unk> .
and the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; which i can &apos;t build myself , that i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , we live here in the northwest , very close to the actual notion of paradise , the 36 times as a garden , <unk> through the streams . &quot;
but the more you add , the more you may seem lost .
and that number of 72 comes never ever before .
this is a nest of a deck colony , and that &apos;s the nest entrance .
this is a colony that has been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the <unk> -- that &apos;s a way to show -- is a interesting group ; they go back in the morning , before the first group of foraging is going on .
oddly , and interestingly , it looks like about half of the ant colony is just not doing anything .
the nest nest nest nest nest nest nest nest nest nest nest nest , you put it down to the <unk> edge of the <unk> and put it there .
the foragers don &apos;t choose , but somehow , to get out .
and we &apos;ve done experiments that show that the longer a ant out outside , the more of the ant out there , the more simple <unk> on their surface , and so they smell different different , they can do different things .
they &apos;re looking at all the earth , from the antarctica .
here &apos;s the cost of all this for the world for about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost three trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s what we do is four percent of the world .
that &apos;s not to do with it .
i think about how we can use natural gas .
and when i got into the <unk> approach , natural gas cost to the <unk> .
why does that doesn &apos;t worry ?
so they were just 500 million .
it never been <unk> water , or something that was similar .
tbp : i lost 150 million of the wind , ok ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was <unk> . and there were <unk> .
<unk> life is an event . do it <unk> the world .
these are working in <unk> manhattan where you built with the first of the first .
and these were in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to be the light socket .
a friend of mine told me that story : which didn &apos;t just wait and wait , but then they had to be the <unk> , when they finally were there , they had to call someone .
so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and so it may not be so warm to you as warm as well as other conversations .
and here is the fundamental idea that <unk> is to good people &apos;s done for people who are going to be <unk> .
basically , it &apos;s about if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or to my family , i &apos;m going to use much less to use the golden rule . okay .
so , the results are going to raise up . this is a zero-sum game .
every form of interdependence , <unk> , forces , forces that humanity humanity
and they tell you , the other people think that america doesn &apos;t have seen and it actually , and they hate america .
most diseases related to poverty , but in the case of the children were the kids who were used to be in the majority of the <unk> , mostly to come from .
a child died a child , but nothing changed .
because you simply don &apos;t have this kind of energy and time to do it , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now the dominant <unk> would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cell cell and that you make you a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that used the proper extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and lo and behold , in about four days , they were <unk> and on the right , and the right you see what we created in culture .
and of course , we wonder now where we &apos;re going to go now ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a <unk> journalist who caught in the <unk> , a young <unk> , which is so many <unk> <unk> , that you &apos;ve taken it out of a <unk> , a <unk> of counterfeit <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new species of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about themselves . surprise . surprise .
you get four good friends of one person who knows their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lying ; they were talking about , and then they were left .
they were told , how big the bath was , or said , the <unk> is so far away from the hotel .
woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , a photograph !
and also , you &apos;re going to <unk> your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes , how often i have been left from life for email , social networks and so on , even though it wasn &apos;t really important to be important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of <unk> .
and everybody who goes down , i went down .
at least for me , because if i &apos;m always doing the same , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very fast .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see myself .
are you nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look like so sweet .
how do i say it &apos;s good , but just that it doesn &apos;t <unk> , ok ?
if you have the <unk> to a long time , it becomes buttermilk .
i call it the era of equal citizenship -- what people are different race or ethnic ethnic groups , but as citizens are all alike alike .
and in egypt , i was discovered eventually .
this had been in london in yemen , in yemen and climbed an airplane to attack america .
there is no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are used for democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if not the only factor , well , the family is a <unk> <unk> .
what happened there was a political coalition that was <unk> for a political goal , and that was the leaders to get to get the leaders .
these tools are going to be very much interesting if they &apos;re going to be more sophisticated .
he <unk> the limits of the individual networks and then they <unk> them .
and because of social networking , chinese students who have been involved in abroad , or companies from the rest of the world that the office in china were there , there were people around the world that they heard .
and finally , the chinese union .
we &apos;re increasingly globally , we &apos;re increasingly global globally , socially , socially and cheap .
but it &apos;s all about <unk> , i &apos;m still going to be like this .
on my fourth <unk> , a comet , a comet over the mountain .
this view is the <unk> up . the first 600 feet of the base base base base .
and this is in camp four .
and there were climber on this ridge ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck weathers , another climber , another climber , in this storm collapsed in the snow .
it &apos;s so tricky , because the top of the top that i sometimes have syringes in the clothes .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can only do it just like it did .
and so it will turn back to the thought of it .
these are sherpas who &apos;s <unk> .
and the fourth thing that is really relevant for me , is , &quot; ideas that we need to participate . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the non-profit ascent , entrepreneurs became a lot of models , and they &apos;re in great ways to society .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy to do because they bring them to bring the ideas to the <unk> of the universal , parliament and the city and so on .
the third thing is again , again .
the second is the <unk> that we have , the people who are entrepreneurs so difficult to create standardized jobs in companies that are in the most <unk> of indian jobs .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you can have a chance to do a modern <unk> , so that you don &apos;t have the <unk> , if you &apos;re older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to choose even to choose again .
although some people on the left doesn &apos;t really like to hear it was actually the revolution in the world that the most profitable industry : the government has no idea . &quot;
they fear no longer .
so this whole <unk> mistrust between the <unk> and the ones that they represent .
<unk> .
every one of those <unk> would have been tracked statistically , two years after the <unk> .
david cameron spent 20 million pounds in a &quot; social fund of &quot; to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investing in social change
i &apos;ve been working on . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even if i &apos;m with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , jack . <unk> , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t find out , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means i &apos;ve just heard of all the one and just with my voice , just with my voice .
and then , at the end of the last thing , with this one , i can <unk> my <unk> , <unk> , let &apos;s repeat .
our people had to try to find 5,000 different varieties of <unk> testing the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to those who say that you can &apos;t do . everybody can do that .
on the right side of the right is a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you a few examples .
you see the blue <unk> transducer .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
many these patients are dropping out of the <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical .
he can stop the surgery anytime .
<unk> street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really really <unk> , and it &apos;s an industry that &apos;s going to be in both direction .
and so , you want to go to the next trend and the next trend and that as quickly as possible .
and their jokes , as the <unk> of a <unk> , really work , really , in this aesthetic .
you need for a lot of lawyers and lots of a lot of lawyers and a lot of the <unk> , and the retailers decided that that &apos;s too expensive .
these are the two <unk> are pretty much endangered inside the logic of the <unk> .
and i want to thank you really , really , i want to thank you a really <unk> presentation , that they created this very <unk> presentation .
and then , i got a boat to a remote <unk> , and i realized that the <unk> i shouldn &apos;t be able to meet , not <unk> .
i think this is one of the <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .
there are numerous ancient <unk> in <unk> everywhere in the u.k. , if you &apos;re doing it , you can notice that the <unk> of the churches were there .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope that by showing these organisms , to help it , and to make it carefully , and to help me to protect their <unk> longevity in the near the way .
let &apos;s imagine something else .
20 years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they also also do their own <unk> , like this , which is used by the <unk> texas in all of the <unk> of mexico .
what did you do with it ?
what could terrorists do today , using the time of the terrorists ?
recently , the bureau of the bureau of the united states has arrested in the united states that these <unk> drones to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> in the united states in the united states .
as we see here , we turn ourselves in certain .
now , the mortality mortality is 70 percent of the time you caught it , but it &apos;s hard .
there are so many people who have murdered that the only <unk> funeral not have been able to <unk> <unk> like this one outside <unk> <unk> .
but then , i hear people as you &apos;re talking about fear , a certain aversion to the risk .
and tragically , in 1999 , when she was working in columbia with the <unk> , with the goal , their culture and language , with two other colleagues from the farc trafficked and tortured and tortured and killed .
and there is no group that the manipulation of the manipulation would be more more than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are simple solutions , lightweight , or , because we don &apos;t think of it as an agent .
but the whole community , all of different <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , would and pray and pray . &quot;
because the <unk> , when she &apos;s full of juice , it &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s green , you &apos;re feeding the world , it &apos;s enough to the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to do my wife to make a little bit of joy .
why do i mean to my wife &apos;s own local <unk> ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is power sequester <unk> and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my wife , &quot; why <unk> you <unk> so <unk> ? &quot;
now , you can access 110 countries . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was there in the last seven years .
then i did huge amounts of training . i swam in <unk> and forth .
it actually happened that the cells in my fingers and <unk> themselves .
and my good friend david saw how i was thinking , and he came up to me and said , &quot; lewis , i know you &apos;ve been 18 years old .
the prospect that you could die of 30 years , 40 years ago .
england , america , japan , japan , africa , congo .
there &apos;s about 100 liters of oil on earth today today , which is unprecedented and nurtured .
now , the end of the story , ok , we just replace it all with conventional , renewables -- but i think that &apos;s more about the story .
so special material that abalone is producing , millions of abalone shell , all day , every year , every year .
and the idea was basically that i &apos;m the <unk> in the hands of great personalities that come and i would interview .
but i wanted to be interviewing , who are different .
in fact , my first <unk> george <unk> was the 97 years old <unk> , and she was also <unk> -- i think that &apos;s how you can define it .
we know the big <unk> , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to share and the point of the thing is to make someone ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t this <unk> , but it was a <unk> for my talk .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand that .
half of the body was weakened , the other one .
this is a <unk> in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a nice things .
there is a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not the painting that we did , but what we actually did .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss <unk> , on the <unk> , from the <unk> of the presidency , the high officials of the state of state .
she &apos;s actually applause by the way .
most of the big companies are now convinced they have to apply to apply guidelines against bribes .
if you want to go into a restaurant if you look at the menu , then you expect you to order it on the card ?
and that was the first time that i thought that the expression of the expression of the face of actually reflects what they thinks about it .
well , it divides his life .
this french painter was known for his 18th century for his life still , but also people were <unk> .
unfortunately , these <unk> are now at the most of other orphans in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i was doing it at a dinner dinner , which their parents gave us to honor .
&quot; congratulations to your <unk> , james .
my father lived most of his <unk> in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our movies , they &apos;re stories where we can identify with .
so it can really bring a young man out there , to be able to think about certain negative things and all of this , or any <unk> behavior .
franco <unk> : so much as a lot of time .
i think this is really the issue of this event .
franco , you &apos;ve described this as an <unk> industry industry industry .
it &apos;s basically a cd . a <unk> .
now the critics critics . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re completely <unk> .
we &apos;re in &quot; portal , because you &apos;re flying walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most importantly , behavior .
i had to shut a few bridges behind me .
everything is refers to the <unk> and students who said that they will deny a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- small boxes and <unk> things that i &apos;ve usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful things i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss knife knife for me to be a participation .
and one day i had a — oh , the way around .
i have the <unk> and the copper very thin , so it &apos;s <unk> .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i &apos;m like <unk> <unk> on my house .
she never got done .
the dome was a wish of <unk> .
it was a attempt to turn this narrow up , this narrow piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 at 76 feet -- in an krill by turn these regions , and the dining room in this pavilion , with a high space in it .
they call this plan <unk> .
here it is .
from the building in the background , it appears like <unk> iceberg in the mountains .
our client doesn &apos;t want to do a galleries , so — and when we met our new acousticians , he said that this was the right shape .
in barcelona i was asked to do a fish , we &apos;re just working on the foot of the <unk> , which is made by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
can we cannot burn <unk> <unk> ?
and one of the things that they found was that they didn &apos;t <unk> .
and this is our <unk> briquettes .
and he has the world &apos;s health effects of <unk> wood and charcoal .
it &apos;s a place where it would be india in this room only three of us would have a car .
so you can use the same concepts like in the united states to move things to the things .
there is a big difference .
after a surgery , everything .
now , this is not surprising . but we also asked them to judge their judgment and intelligence , kindness and intelligence .
he married . he had a son named <unk> .
is this business with our reverberation and our employment with a <unk> phenomenon ?
now i want to tell a little bit of the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are , and where we want to do .
we can replace the network structure under a bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far with replacing the one of the replace .
my topic is food in schools because there &apos;s about social justice .
and the next is <unk> .
people are constantly talking about sustainability . but we should figure out what that &apos;s all .
do you know that everybody would think they would have to eat more and more food ?
and then they have <unk> , hey , we can sell this stuff on children .
and this is a typical <unk> .
the things that we might be doing at home and so important , we need to teach kids in schools in schools .
we need to educate the staff .
this eight billion actually mean , by the way two dollars and 49 cents -- so much money , the government is ready for lunch .
and when little girls sat down to a hot <unk> with me outside the sun .
when i go to a party and people ask me , what i &apos;m doing , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; will your eyes .
i want to <unk> your <unk> , all of you , to know , <unk> , <unk> -- that you &apos;re a professional in your mind .
don &apos;t break that tension . i &apos;d rather like to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s a documentary that &apos;s about consciousness in <unk> .
when i was closer , i thought , all the details of most people can see , their dresses and so on .
where do you know that it was what they did ?
see it ? who &apos;s not going to see ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start with <unk> . some examples .
today , jeff hawkins has described to the effort today , a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the <unk> in london said , &quot; what you &apos;re saying : &quot; who is in the middle of london -- &quot; i mean no one is in charge . &quot;
well , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm on three three 2006 2006 , and the first picture , here is a picture of stockholm , a typical road on the world .
so , we made this huge opportunity to a lot of <unk> and tried to figure out who changed the change and where they disappeared .
then i went around 20 years -- from eastern europe , east eastern asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , <unk> east , north africa , russia .
what we do is the taliban <unk> the taliban who are <unk> on the doors to the people who are going to send their daughters to school like to <unk> in <unk> ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was issued , i had the blue <unk> on the walls .
and there was two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is that ?
now i want to talk about some other patients that are all doing things in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that i remembered the page of google earth reminded where we can fly to each address .
we &apos;re , they &apos;re most <unk> resource in health care .
<unk> from seawater is a <unk> .
here &apos;s the angular . is a wonderful thing , right ?
they don &apos;t take your environment with sound of sound , and i &apos;m talking about the <unk> .
in the united states alone , the annual cost costs to the <unk> cost of the annual cost of the annual billion dollars of dollars , and so bats are going to be wealth .
why should we have aging at the age ?
and if you look at the same room and look at the night sky , and this beautiful , flying animal , i &apos;d like you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be <unk> into the economic development .
the boom of the commodities pumping materials <unk> , not all , but many countries that the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s going wrong ? why is it called &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
and so the countries have the world billion a very <unk> policy .
so , some economists came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t do you try to unveil a auction ? it &apos;s going to unveil the value . &quot;
in that moment , there &apos;s a billion people in poor or <unk> countries , how can we help them ? the economist paul collier asks a fiery agnostic , compassionate plan to conclude that the gap between the gap between the gap .
we don &apos;t have containers ; they &apos;re going to be made .
here he gives a english surgeon in africa that &apos;s <unk> that &apos;s going to be able to do the <unk> surgeries .
so we have this one : imagine , imagine , imagine , and i thought , and could talk to people in their native language .
&quot; the essentials of the <unk> surgery .
14 years ago , i found for the first time in this ordinary material , <unk> , which was used for centuries in the same way .
he asks me whether i could build this as a <unk> piece of a city .
so , we were experimenting with small <unk> <unk> to generate a dry <unk> of wind , and in testing it turns out that it can be also formed by people who can interact with and interact with it , without being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to interact with .
they were in their <unk> at the grass , they were monitored the <unk> patterns of the <unk> next to people who didn &apos;t know , and shared the <unk> of wonder .
and so i also realized that this is an incredible risk for our society .
if peter moves his arm , this yellow spot you see there is the same place to the activity that <unk> <unk> .
if you do this , what will you want to control ?
and to say that these changes can be able to be able to be a claim of death , even a claim that can be true , and it &apos;s wrong .
now let me clear to that , which i don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t say science can be able to be able to be able to be able to have scientific answers to each <unk> moral question .
now , why would this be an objective morality isn &apos;t <unk> ?
how high is the probability that this is a <unk> of the human development ?
on the left side , they see edward <unk> .
we live in a world full of technologies , and these technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always easy to break it than they &apos;re together .
but then we have to talk again over well-being in a larger context .
and what is its natural enemy , what the means of the <unk> of the good beetle , from that we &apos;re talking ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not a <unk> , a <unk> wasp , two millimeters long , slim , a quick and <unk> <unk> .
and if we put these good <unk> for example in a <unk> , you go to the flowers .
in the israel , for example , where we &apos;ve been on over 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s equivalent to 10,000 israeli israeli <unk> -- biological <unk> in <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides are costing .
third , to raise the awareness of farmers to raise this <unk> .
<unk> is one of my favorite <unk> .
it &apos;s even fun about the <unk> rich <unk> than about <unk> . i &apos;m doing .
&quot; urban <unk> -- this is what the new yorkers needs .
her <unk> name was <unk> <unk> , and so that was -- i wasn &apos;t a <unk> enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of the soviet union , only few decades , maybe within a decade , after the time , and the soviet union was the most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that are really insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of <unk> .
why do we actually do that all these balls in the soup , it &apos;s actually meat anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 kilograms per person , a year .
so far we &apos;re going to decide to this , or to five kilograms of output .
we can raise them a little bit on the bottom of the ground , but it &apos;s going to be a dent in a moment .
and you might think , well , they &apos;re not available .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun yet , right ?
he said , &quot; ah , we have to put it on the table .
and i saw a signs .
even if the <unk> system is <unk> , it &apos;s a way that the society has been done .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back , some other gadgets , <unk> , and scales , to make some computations can make . okay ?
right . so , it &apos;s used to use the device .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is called strider .
it &apos;s just used to show you that if you have cameras , it &apos;s because it &apos;s up , it &apos;s a tenth of a second 80 , you can see over obstacles and <unk> <unk> .
for example , in this case , although the left and the left and the right wheel and the right wheel with a single single axis and so quickly .
welcome to <unk> , the robot <unk> lab . &quot;
but the cool thing about it is the <unk> .
let &apos;s see how he does . this was our first first attempt , and ... <unk> !
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just from a radio to speak is not enough .
in this way , education is really important .
<unk> , the to <unk> .
there is basically no pool of good <unk> teachers , and only eight percent of the county have come to the county , or a higher degree .
there is a complete empty <unk> of creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the <unk> on the wheels , then the team won .
but in the last few decades , but much money that was determined for class class , entirely .
and after the time , and interview the neighbors on what they buy and and why , why is a homework assignment .
in this process , it &apos;s been impossible to create large barren space .
i &apos;d like to invite you to the journey of the <unk> and exploration .
after four months of season , it &apos;s taken out , and now it &apos;s got a <unk> season before .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global act is going to do at the climate change , as as fossil fuels , maybe even more than those .
when i learned that two things , i think , and i learned that , both of the personal reasons as well as a scientific reasons .
it has a very <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was partly <unk> by the old <unk> of the foundation .
so , for the treatment , we can make this kid a series of simple <unk> on to see how to adapt vision .
the answer is in movement . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a lot of my wife .
we &apos;re following this <unk> and hopefully , hopefully , to report .
and then i was <unk> by the <unk> for disabled , i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i suppose it , i &apos;m going to see how this is .
but that was 95 and then when the winter of <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , you know aimee &apos;s not done to the <unk> &apos; &apos; 96 , and she &apos;s all excited . your family goes -- it &apos;s a big deal .
i tried everybody who could i was , <unk> against who , against what &apos;s the runners , and what am i am here ?
i &apos;ve been going to be done , and i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> . just take them off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and the designer are going to be two to ted , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
she got somebody who came over and the shoes of the .
it &apos;s almost impossible to see the real losses of economics , it &apos;s because we use copyright copyright .
or to see the 75,000 jobs .
and yet , something about mathematics : mathematics looks like mathematics -- like mathematics -- like in this example , and sometimes they don &apos;t do -- like , &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math math , we &apos;re going to spend about 80 percent of time to teach people how to do three from your own .
when people ask me , is that right ?
but automation allowed to do it to separate these things , so that &apos;s going to be able to separate these things , so that &apos;s going to be a bit different than the building of a car and the learning of its <unk> .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons that this is so important -- so it &apos;s very important to do computers in the exams .
it was in the winter of 2009 , and i was already blind for about a year .
i thought especially on my father , who passed away from an <unk> of interventional surgery on the brain .
similarly , just through the grip of the <unk> , changing the changing texture of soil , and with the time , a sense of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was walking around and the broadway , i was blessed at every single corner .
if you design a city in the blind of the blind , there &apos;s a lot of jobs going to give .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article called &quot; i think you &apos;re every every time . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous ones i knew -- the ten commandments , love your closest , is fertile and <unk> you ...
you give money for a good purpose and it &apos;s been <unk> for the purpose .
she &apos;s not written , and it &apos;s written and the sky <unk> .
so , this is really the key for me , really , the key to be , remembering me that the way you don &apos;t get off the way here , and i came up to the way up to the way .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to really make a sense of things , we really need to be about it , and with it rings .
so we have this amazing progress .
and the academics who had these work that were too <unk> , so we &apos;ve developed <unk> applications like this <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of a <unk> to laser .
alex was working on a small , obscure , independent <unk> with the name of <unk> report , and invited to develop a interface that &apos;s going to be used in the film .
we have this <unk> operation by because we like yellow and <unk> on green <unk> .
let &apos;s move apart : i bring it in <unk> .
we , as humans , they are the things that we should do , and we should make sure that our machines are helping us and build on it .
john , thank you science fiction to reality .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line , said , &quot; we change this deal right now .
they &apos;re created by members of the community for each other .
and as all of good news , you make a leap from 20 years , if the people &apos;s interested in the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days of it . so , we got changes , and we started playing with the <unk> .
india didn &apos;t want to play at the <unk> play .
the other was cricket cricket .
was the new india ? that was a different world where you could get the players from all over the time , as you get the best one .
we &apos;ve had seen games in calcutta , but so we had never seen this . <unk> khan , the audience with a <unk> song to the <unk> -- for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
i hope i &apos;m going to give everybody to give you a experience of getting wealthier and hopefully , the <unk> is a longer time , and in this business .
and you know that the smartest dogs is because they &apos;re very quickly in memory of the same time , how often you dogs and pigs on a leash .
why about everything in the world should have any lottery ?
on the other side , if you go to a developing world , and you can buy for 25 dollars a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your <unk> 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city , to the other end of the city is worth 100 mice , it &apos;s worth completely <unk> . but people don &apos;t think so .
well , in large , you &apos;re enormously selection .
watch what happens when we <unk> <unk> .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more , so you say , that &apos;s the answer to terrorism , i mean , that he &apos;s a kind of mental mistake ?
there are no weapons <unk> .
and so , some people look at economists as stupid people .
and the issue and variation is one of those <unk> that requires certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always going to compare the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in fact , in fashion , there &apos;s the same rule of beauty when it &apos;s really fantastic when too , and is the first thing that is the last new attempted / one last the first of the old .
and i woke up and said , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first of the -- my willingness to be not to be in critical audience without agreeing i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s my intention to be on with the poster of <unk> , they should not understand it .
so , in large , and all of us , they survive .
jews have a unpleasant smell of smell .
if the space , we could see that people are more negative attitudes to <unk> men .
it &apos;s like i was to talk about what i &apos;ve done in this 20 years .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re <unk> .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need any trouble taking the idiots out .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea is that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that had to be so much psychological trauma , and africa has to live with it .
through the whole book , more than an hour of <unk> <unk> and interactive animations .
what &apos;s the business ?
it had at least that you seem to be , and also , mostly true , they could stay .
so i thought , &quot; yes , it &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk about it .
when i was in college , i worked in california , and you were looking at the pristine <unk> on the roofs and things like that .
rsw : how does your schedule look like ?
the <unk> -- they &apos;ve interviewed me for mit , and they sent their technical <unk> to bilbao .
that &apos;s remembered me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you were three months to three months , the ideas will always get more and more and more alive .
and one thing i was to mention with my <unk> , but somehow , it was to thank all the company that helped me to get the way .
but in the meanwhile , these things are going to be momentum .
and this is a 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> and things is remarkable , and this is to be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible undertaking , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes and the sixth is built here .
on this level , the 1,500 workers work .
50 percent of the computer in the world land in the world , in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan sagmeister that less than five percent of advertisements , a picture of the ad .
and the wish is three is <unk> . i was told to myself a person , and i always wanted to work on this stuff .
and it &apos;s increasingly important that we find out how we can get these materials from this extremely complex <unk> .
the traditional ways of separate material , not simply work for <unk> .
the traditional way of making it <unk> , it &apos;s going to be done with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed <unk> : many different types of <unk> and lots of different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they make the same <unk> .
here &apos;s mayday . it &apos;s going to take a token for food and wait happy , and you get food .
she &apos;s a little bit to have a little bit of it to open the market .
now imagine that i push each of them 1,000 <unk> dollars in your hand -- 10 <unk> <unk> .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so i throw a coin . in your head you &apos;re really losing .
if we were in our little <unk> , the same scenarios , they would be the same things like humans do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development , the stupid mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about these cells , the most of the most of the most of four stories are up .
we have to build less with concrete and steel and we have to build higher , we &apos;ve been working on <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s as much , as we would have been less cars less on the streets .
<unk> curtains my window .
maybe even by the time , because recently , they &apos;ve got up to fight against the decline of justice , the citizens of these networks are together to help each other .
<unk> , the biggest and the oldest bank in russia , mostly in the russian government uses now to use of crowdsource to developing employees and citizens in the developing development of innovation .
we &apos;ve heard about ted talks about people who have their plants with <unk> , and <unk> work on the world young people to create web sites and make videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all the kids there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked her to transmit a message , and all of reading in their own language , a central <unk> that was a version of the golden rule , &quot; which you don &apos;t want to do to do that , no other . &quot;
being a pastor is to be taking these individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this by some <unk> .
there is a hundred thousand messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber .
there is also some limitations on its lighting .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i was watching my aunt raped when i was just five .
one of the things that i was experiencing when i was trying to eat my friend because we didn &apos;t eat the 400 .
as a child as young and <unk> , i cannot forget , not forget .
that &apos;s my story , i &apos;m a lesson of a lesson .
my breakfast , my lunch , i have a foundation that i founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : aye .
the third chapter is a more complicated <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent is it .
we &apos;re going to solve this task to the best , by making the <unk> of death .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
the santa <unk> knows whether you were <unk> or not . &quot; right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were so ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense , that was the right answer , and then they asked them , &quot; do you think we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the hardest view of the modern times . &quot;
in the second world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it needs a fundamental contribution to do , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , to the good news .
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and at this point , the skeptics and <unk> of climate change in vision .
we &apos;ve done a project for the <unk> couple years ago , a big program called the <unk> -- with many , many people -- many experts were involved -- all of the evidence -- it &apos;s <unk> .
a group of asking them to spend it on themselves and the other group is to spend it for other people .
when they went from the first building to the second , everybody would be over a man who <unk> and moan , and i certainly needed help . the question is : they would be at the way ?
the word is &quot; <unk> &quot; is a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there is a wonderful book called &quot; <unk> : the hidden life of life .
since since , now , there &apos;s four decades -- i &apos;ve been trained with the best in this area , the world of these worldwide , have young and old , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , a rich web of art , successes and accolades .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my power , my passion , my real life system .
i danced between <unk> and <unk> and scraping these to my <unk> .
well , it was basically frustration .
that &apos;s what it was .
he put together , put together , this to something <unk> , and then he turned them into this software that they had originally created his son . and he created this amazing presentation .
in these documents there are little <unk> , little boxes .
i &apos;m going to suggest -- yes , you &apos;re making a beautiful website , and how could i say to be a beautiful website ?
now , the way you ask the linked data , which you now have put together , 32 hits , which is every one of a protein with these features and you can look at them .
and it &apos;s about data data .
all of this will lead two million children fewer dying , in the last year , when in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s like this , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback , and to build feedback and give them to make sure that these promises really actually deliver outcomes ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that number ?
my brothers started to draw their teeth and draw on .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m fascinated with exploring this area .
how many of you have a cow on the road , right now , the way of bangalore after mysore ?
it &apos;s just as people to do it , the reality is so , and that makes the importance of it .
and they said , &quot; is fine .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box of <unk> .
because , if we can see somebody , we see it footprint .
what percentage of them turned out of foreign <unk> ?
obviously , he has the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the <unk> is actually nicely suited to get this point because -- if you think about it , i think about the economists <unk> assumption that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place i &apos;ve shown you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a bit of technical .
think about toyota .
they can &apos;t take it off , so they accept it and find it to work .
it &apos;s very hard to vote .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza , you get them to hunger .
there are millions of different varieties of <unk> .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activity , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s the poet <unk> chen , and it goes to this : &quot; i can &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> .
and that is : &quot; how much of the day do you think about this person ? &quot;
in over the societies , people have <unk> <unk> on these <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the <unk> home .
and it really became a strong force .
and i reply , &quot; why do you think men are more <unk> than women ? &quot;
not at any time on this were , the women were so educated , so interesting , so that way .
she &apos;s 23 she was taken her her since her left since her .
i started to <unk> why you &apos;re more in love with one person than the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare is called this <unk> spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask whether it could be that the insulin resistance is that the insulin resistance is to gain weight and catastrophic diseases -- at least people ?
others , it &apos;s too much more <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our perspectives were wrong ?
my great grandfather , henry ford , really , it really was that the mission of the ford company was to improve the lives of people and make cars for everyone .
and the good news is that we &apos;re today the big problems of cars and environment -- not just at ford , but in total of industry .
i think you can already imagine .
but what i really inspired is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to start when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that &apos;s capable of support these flexible future .
that &apos;s a minute of <unk> .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m like this kind of <unk> .
the nurse have to take data on data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what did that came out ?
and it was great for us , because we won a lot of prizes .
i was infected when i was 17 , when i was 17 , when a student of a <unk> , i was found , i was really , i think , really thought of my ideas , i had <unk> and lots of <unk> <unk> with me .
now it was just about the kids . so we don &apos;t <unk> .
basically , we gave the kids a simple job .
for our auction , we have some wonderful pictures for them , for a really good purpose , the money that you &apos;re going to be used to buy aids aids .
but what i &apos;ve never said , and what i want to do is is that &apos;s cool .
in a way , in the elegant , the product that we have here , we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , which is another kind of different things -- and inspired by the incredible experience of experience .
if you think about change in our society , the <unk> of the country has taken over 200 years , the same process has happened in 20 years .
it looked changes even though that were not known yet .
so we would put the models under an artificial sky .
i think a reduction in the heart of 94 percent of it .
and how do we do something in this growing world , especially in some places that i &apos;m talking about -- china for example , the next 10 years , there are going to build 400 new airports .
and this is the focus of the <unk> talk -- there is no lighting in the positive sense that promotes healthy and our well-being without adequate .
in contrast , the first office , i showed you to the beginning of the talk , this is a very well-known office office , which is that the <unk> .
and behind you can see the <unk> building , which was a <unk> of modern <unk> .
i find this quite amazing -- how much light in the sky and never reach the ground .
this is not very pleasant and <unk> .
they won &apos;t be disturbed by it .
if our <unk> , as a few weeks before , a war in a third of india <unk> , about 200 <unk> , the <unk> is , he &apos;s the subject .

the second thing to be it had to be extremely cheap .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers who had found access to a technology that has enabled it to change his life .

first of the way , developed countries , and then in a second world project , even over the 50 american states , with the same question : the more unequal states are all of these scales ?
with devastating effects of the use of talents of the population .

we have a simple digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital lab and make a <unk> for every patient for every patient .
our dental revenue is clearly very quickly , what makes us make a healthy profit , and that even though we treat a lot of people .
that &apos;s a difficult job .
for example , we can put digital content with physical mass .

so , shortly after i &apos;m sitting in a wheelchair , i &apos;ve taken more in the living in the wheelchair than outside it .
over generations , we &apos;ve been equally as raised as millions of other species that live with us .
but it &apos;s not a normal movie .
but if i just took a base of a base of every base of this screen at every single layer of the resolution of <unk> x <unk> , we would need to take 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome .

and we &apos;ve heard of history from the family tree from the bloodline from the bloodline of the human tree .
in the most of the most of the most of the most examples of compassion , too , too , too , to love and real altruism .

and you know what i mean . i &apos;m talking about the pollution .
take the <unk> for all the problems that we &apos;ve seen the planet in terms of the environment and in social . it &apos;s a message of hope .

working with the plastic , about the plastic , about the first eight years , some of my pieces started breaking apart and break into smaller <unk> .

okay . the <unk> is used by thousands of people worldwide .
or we could use one of these here here .
mao <unk> <unk> has been described them as the european civil wars , and that &apos;s probably a accurate description .
my mind is , ladies and gentlemen , is that this probably probably not been possible by the founding possible possible .
they &apos;re starting to see the <unk> of a <unk> world .
but this is not more the case .
the <unk> of nations , well , that we &apos;ve always had .
but now one last thing .
but if you ask the question today , as the optimal formula for a long life , he may not tell you .

they have what we want .
we &apos;re now at half .
